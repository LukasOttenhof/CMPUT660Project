sorted list freeze when changing sort order in friends list problem when users changed the sorting order from alphabetical to last seen in the friends list the screen would freeze indefinitely and the sorted list would not display analysis of the logcat revealed that only 19 out of 36 firebase realtime database rtdb queries completed before the sorting process hung root cause the method initiates firebase rtdb queries to fetch heartbeat data for each friend individually however some of these queries were hanging and never completing neither success nor failure callbacks were triggered since the sorting logic waited for all queries to complete before proceeding the ui froze indefinitely when even one query hung the same issue could theoretically affect which uses batched firestore queries solution added a 5 second timeout mechanism to both sorting methods to ensure the ui never freezes timeout protection when sorting begins a 5 second timeout is scheduled using android s if all queries complete before timeout the timeout is cancelled and sorting proceeds normally if timeout triggers a warning is logged showing completion progress e g completed 19 of 36 fetches missing data is filled with sensible defaults 0 for heartbeat null for nickname sorting proceeds with available data ui is updated with sorted results within 5 seconds maximum enhanced logging added comprehensive progress logging to help diagnose future issues code quality improvements extracted constant to class level for maintainability added late callback protection to ignore responses arriving after timeout removed obsolete helper method enhanced error logging in both sorting methods changes modified added imports added constant 5 seconds enhanced with timeout mechanism and progress logging enhanced with timeout mechanism for consistency removed obsolete completion checking method created comprehensive documentation of the issue solution and testing recommendations testing code compiles successfully no new security vulnerabilities introduced code review feedback addressed recommended manual testing switch between sort modes multiple times to ensure responsive ui verify sorting completes within 5 seconds even with many friends check that sorted list displays correctly with partial data monitor logcat for timeout warnings and progress tracking expected behavior before ui freezes indefinitely when

scenarios root cause analysis the method had binary logic that only handled one specific case this logic crashed in 7 out of 8 common scenarios including when both values are when one is and the other isn t when paths are legitimately different normal for launch mode fix implementation replaced the flawed logic with robust intent handling key improvements 1 null safety uses for null safe comparison including both null scenarios 2 proper android behavior calls as expected for launch mode activities 3 smart validation only warns doesn t crash for potentially problematic online multiplayer scenarios 4 better logging informative debug and warning messages for monitoring 5 fixed typo dirrenten different context android singletop launch mode uses in androidmanifest xml when a new intent targets an already running activity with this launch mode android calls instead of creating a new instance this is normal android behavior not an error condition the method should handle these legitimate intent updates gracefully testing manual validation created comprehensive test showing the fix resolves crashes in all problematic scenarios unit tests added with thorough coverage of edge
