"Question re: json representation of Map<String,V>
Hi.

I think that json provides a better way to represent a Map&lt;String,V&gt; than json-io uses.

Consider this demonstration:

```
public static void main(String args[]) throws ConfigurationException {
    Map<String, Object> feedback = new LinkedHashMap<>();
    String input[] = {""foo"",""bar"",""baz"" }; 
    for (String s : input) {
        try {
            feedback.put(s, doStuff(s));
        } catch (Exception e) {
            feedback.put(s, e);
        }
    }
    System.out.println(JsonWriter.toJson(feedback));
}

private static Object doStuff(String s) throws Exception {
    if (""bar"".equals(s)){
        return new XMLConfiguration();
    } else {
        throw new Exception(""Error!"");
    }
}
```

...Which outputs this:

Now, since I'm using json-io for debugging/logging, I'd rather this output be more like this...

...Of course, I just hand-edited the json string to lay it out like that.  What I've done is represented the Map as an array of (json) objects, rather than an array of keys followed by and array of values.

I believe that right around https://github.com/jdereg/json-io/blob/master/src/main/java/com/cedarsoftware/util/io/JsonWriter.java#L1379 is the spot to make this change, but since I am sure this proposal would break deserialization, I thought I'd check with you first. :)

What do you think?  Is there a way to do this right?  Is it a good thing to do?  Can it be used for Map&lt;K,V&gt;, not just Map&lt;String,V&gt; ?

"I initially tried this, but had problems with it. Some of the difficulties are the fact that Maps in Java can have non-String keys, and secondly, I believe there was a forward reference issue.  

If you are serializing between Java and Java, this is a non issue.  If you are serializing to Javascript, then you may be scratching your head, asking what you do with the @keys and @items, right?  There is Javascript code that walks the object graph after it is loaded on the Javascript side, and recreates the Javascript maps.  This is done after resolveRefs(), which does the @id/@ref substitution.  

Also, there is Javascript code that replaces 'pointers' with @id/@ref pairs on the outbound side, so that proper graph shape is maintained when being sent to the server.  Think of it like 'stringify()' plus it properly handles cycles.  With this Javascript code (and json-io), full Java object graphs can be serialized and deserialized back-n-forth without any issues.

Finally, there is a Spring MessageConverter class that plus into Spring MVC so that json-io is the serialization provider (we were using Jackson, but with json-io we have full graph marshaling and it handles collection fields better).

Back to your original point, the method you mention is where the change would be made to attempt to write out the graph as pairs of keys (remember these can be complex graphs) and values.  If you take a stab at making this change to JsonWriter and get it writing Maps this way correctly (testing with Lists, Maps, and other narly objects as the key), the JsonReader change should be manageable.",2014-01-01 01:07:45+00:00,i initially tried this but had problems with it some of the difficulties are the fact that maps in java can have non string keys and secondly i believe there was a forward reference issue if you are serializing between java and java this is a non issue if you are serializing to javascript then you may be scratching your head asking what you do with the keys and items right there is javascript code that walks the object graph after it is loaded on the javascript side and recreates the javascript maps this is done after resolverefs which does the id substitution also there is javascript code that replaces pointers with id pairs on the outbound side so that proper graph shape is maintained when being sent to the server think of it like stringify plus it properly handles cycles with this javascript code and json io full java object graphs can be serialized and deserialized back n forth without any issues finally there is a spring messageconverter class that plus into spring mvc so that json io is the serialization provider we were using jackson but with json io we have full graph marshaling and it handles collection fields better back to your original point the method you mention is where the change would be made to attempt to write out the graph as pairs of keys remember these can be complex graphs and values if you take a stab at making this change to jsonwriter and get it writing maps this way correctly testing with lists maps and other narly objects as the key the jsonreader change should be manageable,2014-01-01 01:07:45+00:00,Refactoring & Cleanup,0.13155757,0.119200386,0.115135595,0.11495416,0.13175963,0.12720653,0.13120547,0.12898062,before

"Dave,

Now I see what you were talking about.  I think I misunderstood your
question.  I got ahead of myself on a comment and have yet to check in the
work (field filtering) that I mention in the comment.  I will remove that
from the comment for now.

Field fitlering is coming soon.  PUBLIC, ALL_BUT_TRANSIENT, ALL, and a
FieldFilter that you write and associate to a class, allowing your class to
selectively decide what fields get serialized.  This will be pretty easy to
implement and further increases json-io's power.

"Rather than make @pairs an [] of String key to {} (object), you might want to try this instead:

```
""@pairs"":[[key0, value0], [key1, value1], ... [key-n, value-n]]

This would at least allow for non-strings as keys.  This approach would keep the key and associated value 'near' each other.  On the reader side, it would have to pull apart these fixed, 2-element key/value arrays and make Map entries for each.

If I recall correctly, I think I tried this in the past, however, it still requires 'remapping' when it hits the Javascript side.  In addition, I was able to treat the @keys as a list and @items as a list, and therefore writing maps was trivial as the collection writer and collection entry writer code is used on these portions of map.  If I had gone with the fixed, 2-element approach above, the map writer would require more code.  Since this effort still does not give you a Javascript map the way you are thinking of it (without Javascript code that converts it), I scuttled the effort.

"Maybe unnecessary call of convertParsedMapsToJava inside JsonReader.readObject()
In version 2.6.1, if I don't want to have the java object but only the map representation of the json (by giving the constructor 'true' for noObjects), convertParsedMapsToJava is still invoked - is this necessary or simply an unnecessary overhead in this case? This is the readObject() code from JsonReader:

```
public Object readObject() throws IOException
{
    Object o = readJsonObject();
    if (o == EMPTY_OBJECT)
    {
        return new JsonObject();
    }

    if (_noObjects)
    {

    }
    return graph;
}

Maybe it could be more efficient if convertParsedMapsToJava is only invoked if necessary:

```

{
    Object o = readJsonObject();
    if (o == EMPTY_OBJECT)
    {

"Feature request: add an optional fallback type parameter for the toplevel json container to JsonReader.jsonToJava(json);
We give the possibility to specify http get parameters also as json strings, to allow class objects as parameter types for the web interfaces also.

The problem is, by using json-io, specifying @type in the json string is mandatory for deserialization, right? Thus, the users have to specify it, which is not so nice (for the return values its fine of course, but for parameters?)

I love the way json-io deals with types, for me, it is the best solution to support polymorphism I have seen in such a library. Nevertheless, in this case, the underlying type of the parameter normally not changes - it should be transparent for the (e.g. javascript) user of the interface who creates the json, and clear for the server.

Is it possible to add another method to JsonReader.jsonToJava(String json, Class toplevelFallbackType) - where toplevelFallbackType could be also String, Type, etc. of course.
This parameter would then be used as fallback if the @type was not specified in the toplevel json object.
I know this would not work with polymorphism, but it would help us a lot and would be maybe a nice enhanchement of json-ios functionality:)

So although the outer method is called convertParsedMapsToJava() perhaps it should be called convertParsedMapsToJavaOrMaps().  I don't like the 'OR' in the method name.

"@type is not mandetory to be specified in the JSON.  There are many circumstances where you can leave it out:

In the case of any field of an object, the @type parameter can be left off, if the value associated to the field is the exact same type of the field (usually the case).  When the JSON reader encounters JSON data without the @type, it looks at the field of the object, and instantiates the object as the field type in that case.  Where this does not work, is when the field is an abstract class or interface.  There is special handling for the Collection classes (intelligent Collection and Map types are used).  @type is also required when the field type is a superclass of the actual type written.  For example, if you a class Person and Employee is derived from Person.  If the field type is Person but it is polymorphically pointing to an Employee, and the @type is not written, then the JsonReader cannot instantiate the class as an Employee, as it does not know that what to instantiate.  The best it could do is instantiate a Person.  If person is concrete, then it will instantiate it as Person, and the Employee fields would be dropped (not desired).  JsonWriter allows compares the instance type to the field type and does NOT write the @type out in these cases, so that the resulting JSON is smaller.

Another case where @type can be dropped is when you have a specific array type.  An Employee[] of Employee objects.  In this case, the @type, if missing on the Employee objects inside the array, will be inferred from the type of the Array.  However, if the array was an Object[], then it cannot make this inference.  JsonWriter compares the Objects inside an array [] when writing them, and drops the @type in this case to make the resulting JSON smaller.

@type can be left off of Object[] of Strings, Object[] of longs, Object[] of booleans, Object[] of doubles.  In all those cases, it can infer the type.  Furthermore, these can be placed into the JSON as their native types, as opposed to JSON Objects{} in this case.  JsonWriter special handles these types so that they are written as JSON primitives (long, double, String, boolean).",2014-07-10 00:35:21+00:00,type is not mandetory to be specified in the json there are many circumstances where you can leave it out in the case of any field of an object the type parameter can be left off if the value associated to the field is the exact same type of the field usually the case when the json reader encounters json data without the type it looks at the field of the object and instantiates the object as the field type in that case where this does not work is when the field is an abstract class or interface there is special handling for the collection classes intelligent collection and map types are used type is also required when the field type is a superclass of the actual type written for example if you a class person and employee is derived from person if the field type is person but it is polymorphically pointing to an employee and the type is not written then the jsonreader cannot instantiate the class as an employee as it does not know that what to instantiate the best it could do is instantiate a person if person is concrete then it will instantiate it as person and the employee fields would be dropped not desired jsonwriter allows compares the instance type to the field type and does not write the type out in these cases so that the resulting json is smaller another case where type can be dropped is when you have a specific array type an employee of employee objects in this case the type if missing on the employee objects inside the array will be inferred from the type of the array however if the array was an object then it cannot make this inference jsonwriter compares the objects inside an array when writing them and drops the type in this case to make the resulting json smaller type can be left off of object of strings object of longs object of booleans object of doubles in all those cases it can infer the type furthermore these can be placed into the json as their native types as opposed to json objects in this case jsonwriter special handles these types so that they are written as json primitives long double string boolean,2014-07-10 00:35:21+00:00,Documentation & Communication,0.12575209,0.121822216,0.13319424,0.11967915,0.12044308,0.14030397,0.1214122,0.11739307,before

could have a Set as a key, or a Date, an Employee class, etc.  Because of
that, you cannot assume the key is a String.  The approach taken by json-io

"Cannot deserialize type with generics
Having the following code:

``` java
public class ADouble<T> {

    private T field2;

    public ADouble(T field1, T field2) {
        this.field1 = field1;

``` json

ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException.  I added test with a multi-template class
that use two fields of one template type, and one of the other.  The test
now passes.  The ArrayIndexOutOfBounds exception will no longer occur,
however, I still have some work to do to perfect handling the associated
template variable to the associated value.  What I have works pretty good,
and works in many cases you would not expect it to, because the type can be
figured out later.  Let me know if you have any further issues related to
template support.

"strange ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException during deserialization, depending on type parameters
I have a strange error while deserializing one of my data structures. The structure is too complex to post it here, but I managed it to create a small snippet to reproduce the problem:

``` java
import com.cedarsoftware.util.io.JsonReader;
import com.cedarsoftware.util.io.JsonWriter;


public class FeldWaldWiese
{
    static public class Test<K, V>
    {
        // WORKING:
//        protected Test2 m_internalHashMap = new Test2();
        // NOT WORKING:
        protected Test2<K, V> m_internalObject = new Test2<>();
    }

    static public class Test2<K, V>
    {
        //strange: if I leave just one of the members, it is working.
        //Maybe the member count is relevant. It seems to be independent from the members type
        int i;
        int y;
        String check;
    }

    {
        Test item = new Test();

        JsonReader.jsonToJava(JsonWriter.objectToJson(item));

}
```

the snippet generates following exception:

If I leave the type parameters from the member in the container class 'Test', no exception will be thrown. If I leave one of the parameters inside the class 'Test2', also no exception is thrown. It seems to me that the problem starts if more than 2 member variables are in the second class.

"You are right and I'm sorry, I thinked I had 2.9.0, but accidently Maven prefered a conflicting 2.7.2 for reasons I don't know.
Nevertheless, with 2.9.0, I fall into another failure. I was able to create a test snippet for it also:

```

Deserialisation also fails depending on having type parameters or not. The snippet throws following exception:

"FIELD_SPECIFIERS does not allow subclasses field to be serialized
Hello,
Here is the documentation for FIELD_SPECIFIER map option for serializing objects
`// Set value to a Map<Class, List<String>> which will be used to control which fields on a class are output`
So what I understand from this is that it will only specify the field for given class to be serialized but implicitly means that subclasses fields shall be serialized.
But this is not the case.
here is the test case that show the opposite.

```
    @Test
    void testExternalFieldSpecifierInheritance()
    {
        Map<Class, List<String>> fieldSpecifiers = [(PainfulToSerialize.class):['name']]
        MorePainfulToSerialize painful = new MorePainfulToSerialize()
        painful.name = ""Android rocks""
        painful.age = 50;

        def args = [(JsonWriter.FIELD_SPECIFIERS):fieldSpecifiers]
        String json = JsonWriter.objectToJson(painful, args)
        Map check = (Map) JsonReader.jsonToJava(json, [(JsonReader.USE_MAPS):true] as Map)
        assertTrue(check.size() == 1)
        assertTrue(check.containsKey(""name""))
```

here I would expect the MorePainfulToSerialize.age to be serialized because we only specified the _name_ field for the parent class PainfulToSerialize.

If so, the only way to do that all at once is to put them in a List or
Object[] and serialize them as you have above.  The Object[] might make the

But my enums continue to be written out as:
""federationStrategy"":{""name"":""FEDERATE_THIS"",""ordinal"":1}

I've tried this with both a stand alone class such as:

`public enum FederationStrategy
{
	EXCLUDE, FEDERATE_THIS, FEDERATE_ORIGIN;

	public static FederationStrategy fromName(String name)
	{
		for (FederationStrategy type : values())
		{
			if (type.name().equalsIgnoreCase(name))
			{
				return type;
			}
		}
		return FEDERATE_THIS;
	}

	public boolean exceeds(FederationStrategy type)
	{
		return this.ordinal() > type.ordinal();
	}

	public boolean atLeast(FederationStrategy type)
	{
		return this.ordinal() >= type.ordinal();
	}

	@Override
	public String toString()
	{
		return name();
	}
}`

But also, with the enum FederationStrategy as an enum embedded in another class.

Can you include some examples of mapping you think would work?  I highly
recommend avoiding having the same class name with different outer classes.
This is much the same as having two packages with the same class name. At
this point you really need to have your own alias.

"The aliases on apply to classes rather than fields.

So you could have

class User {
    class Type {
    }
}

and

class Asset {
    class Type {
    }
}

However, I would prefer to have a UserType and AssetType. esp as there is
already a built in Type interface.

In many cases the default pattern isn't suitable so you can add your own
alias such as

ClassAliasPool.CLASS_ALIASES.addAlias(ByteStore.class, ""!binary"");

"failed to deserialize EnumSet with json without type

"I think we'll want to maintain support for both java 8 & java 9 on the same master branch, rather than having multiple branches.

I've committed changes to Chronicle-Core that allow it to build on java 9 without any special modifications. The java 9-specific code is hidden behind `Jvm.isJava9Plus()`.

Because of the need to maintain API compatibility between different libraries, it's going to be necessary to use existing APIs such as `StringUtils.extractChars` in Chronicle-Bytes, etc. In future, these may be special-cased for performance, but for now, just getting everything to build on java 8 & 9 is enough to be getting on with.

Unfortunately, that means that your work is not compatible with the direction I think we'll take. I've made similar changes to Chronicle-Bytes and Chronicle-Wire allowing them to be build with java 9:

`mvn -P java9 test`

If you'd be happy to redo some of the work against the master branch of -Bytes or -Wire, such that it will build on *either* java 8 or java 9, then please submit a pull-request for review.

"JLBH: [Feature] Use JLBH in xUnit types of tests
JLBH is a great and simple tool to measure latencies, partially thanks to easy to follow, human readable reports. Recently I tried to use it to use it as part of TDD process when developing components for a latency sensitive application and I realized that there is no API that can be used to create automated tests that can be run in a production-like, performance focused CI environment to avoid introducing latency regressions and to continuously increase performance of the existing app. The fully automated, xUnit style of testing would allow that. Example:
```java

  @Test
  public void shouldRespondWithin50usForTheMostCommonTypeOfRequest() throws Exception {
    // given
    JLBHTask unitUnderTest = new TaskInvokingTheUnitYouWantToMeasure();
    JLBH jlbh = new JLBH(new JLBHOptions().jlbhTask(unitUnderTest) /* other options */);

    // when
    jlbh.start();

    // then
    Result result = ... // somehow retrieve the result
    assertTrue(result.getEndToEndLatencies().get99thPercentileInNs() <= 50_000)
  }
```

"Add support for pinning views
Update: https://github.com/wieslawsoltes/Dock/pull/164 brings new model for pinned dock, the pinned docks are supported only in IToolDock.

- [x] Implement object model
- [ ] Implement dock factory logic
- [ ] Implement UI presentation

Proposal for pinned views support in Dock control.

# Model

* Add `IToolDock` interface to controls to be used for pinned views in tool dock.
* Add `IsExpanded` property to `IToolDock`.
* Add `AutoHide` property to `IToolDock`.
* Add implementation to `INPC`, `ReactiveUI` and `Avalonia` models.
* When `IDockable` is pinned, remove it from visibible dockable collection and add to pinned dockables collection.

# UI

* Add `TabStrip` with `PinnedDockables`  and pinned dockables detail view to  `ToolControl`.
* If the pin button for `IDockable` is clicked by user remove it from visibible dockable collection and add to pinned dockables collection..
* If the user clicks on the `TabStrip` and `AutoHide` is set to `True` it reveals the tool overlaying the central UI and sets `IsExpanded` to `true`, if cursor is not over the view and `AutoHide` is set to `true` set `IsExpanded` to `false`.

"SplitToWindow is not collapsing splitter
Collapsing the splitters does not work if a tool is dropped into a new window.
The resulting splitter that is left can crash the application if you accidently use it.

I tried to fix it myself but I was not sucessfull without messing up the entire code structure.
However the problem currently is that the line:
 `RemoveDockable(dockable, true);` (Factorybase. line 723) 
passes a tooldock that has children.
RemoveDockable calles Collapse() but that does not work if it has children.
`if (dock.IsCollapsable && dock.VisibleDockables.Count == 0)`

"StringBuilder/String ""coder"" field reflection caching
Currently, for each string (field or value) deserialized using the high-level Chronicle-Queue interface. The `String`/`StringBuilder` `coder` value is assessed using reflection ( to be more precise, the wrong field is assessed, an exception is thrown and then recovered from).

This incurs quite a huge performance penalty for deserialization operation, you might imagine.

"Ok then create a new repo and move it. Although I don’t understand why they can’t use it in the current repo. What’s the benefit of moving it out of core. 

There is, of course, the added job of changing the place(s) where it is used for example in the fix benchmarks and changing the release job so that it builds when the BOM is updated.  But if it’s that’s simple, and  you can do all this in 5 mins, probably better to spend the time in moving it rather than us debating why we should or should not move it, also can you move our documentation we have if it ( if any ) into this new repo as well.

```

                // [Out of RFC 4627] accept NaN/Infinity values
                readToken(""infinity"");

"Compatibility issues on JDK 14
Hi

as previously described in [here](https://github.com/OpenHFT/Chronicle-Queue/issues/652)

sun.nio.ch.FileChannelImpl.map0 implementation has changed on JDK 14, requiring an additional boolean param.

This makes CQ unusable on that version of the JDK (works fine on JDK 13).

Tested with CQ version 5.19.2

"Improve EventHandler termination performance
It is possible to create a subclass of InvalidEventHandlerException that only exists as a singleton (e.g. SingletonInvalidEventHandlerException) and that is statically created. EventHandlers that only use the InvalidEventHandlerException as a means of removing itself from the EventLoop could use the static Exception for pure removal with no underlying exception to signal. This will improve loop performance and reduce jittering.

Whenever a Chronicle library, like Queue or Map, is first used in an application, it would be useful if certain information elements are output to the logs.

* Java version
* Process id
* Library specific additional information (e.g. for datagrid: the used YAML configuration file and the server id)

"Is there a way to avoid ClassCastException without using @type fields on a JSON object?
If I attempt to deserialize JSON that was serialized with the default JsonWriter type settings, I can cast it to a typed object successfully. However, if I attempt to deserialize JSON that was serialized with JsonWriter.TYPE = false, I receive a ClassCastException.

Is there any way to avoid this without needing to rely on the `@type` parameters? The reason I'm asking is because the objects I use are quite complex, and there's a lot of `@type` data being sent. Not serializing `@type` parameters can help me save ~3kB per request on smaller objects in my system (~6kB per round-trip).

Perhaps a solution would be new implementation of method `JsonReader.readObject(Class)` that would make a best attempt at deserialization without any `@type` parameters? Using generics, theoretically it could recursively walk the JsonObject structure and attempt to match the value up with the values of declared Fields on the Class object given, and you could avoid infinite recursion by using the already inbuilt `@ref` and `@id` tags. These are just my first thoughts on a solution, maybe you have something more elegant in mind.

Below is the deserialization code, and the full exception stack trace.

```
JsonReader jsonReader = new JsonReader(request.getInputStream(), DBObjectServletUtils.jsonObjectOptions);
object = (T) jsonReader.readObject();
```

}
```

Now the Java object you want to read it into looks like this (two examples)
Class A
{
   Map field1;
   Boolean field2;
}

Class B
{
   Person field1;
   Boolean field2;
}

Class C
{
  Object field1;
  Boolean field2;
}

In this example, which class should be instantiated to hold the result?  It
is completely ambiguous.  The JSON reader code has a Map when it finishes
reading the  { ""name"": ...} portion of the JSON.  Now the field it must
assign this too and it's enclosing class, how does it work?  That { ""name""
...} portion will work for any of these three classes.  So the reader does
not know which one to instantiate.

This is why I said if you want to work without @types, then use Map of Map
structures and the Map reader version of json-io.  ""Hard"" Data Transfer
Objects (DTOs) are a thing of the past in my humble opinion.  You can write
rules that generically walk ""Map of Map"" graphs and validate their values,
transform their values, etc.  Why bother building explicit Java classes
that look the same as Maps, with hard-coded fields and getter/setters on
them?

This spills into a more advanced technique where you can create ""DTO""
classes that are derived (extend) LinkedHashMap.  Think about these data
transfer type classes - why do you need to declare fields on them?  Just
declare API on them - getters/setters and have those methods uses the Map's
put/get to store the values.  These serialize out correctly for Jackson or
json-io.  If you are interested in this technique, I will publish one of
those DTO classes that derives from LinkedHashMap here as an example.

"I can see how this would be an issue. However, I'm trying to basically skip using a ""DTO"" entirely. I've built a front end that knows how to interact with unflattened objects, and that's why I'm using your library (because it can handle nested objects with circular dependencies.). 

In the scenario provided above, it looks like you are not giving a class parameter to your deserialization function. If you had the same given JSON string, but instead had the below class definitions:

```
class A {
 String name;
 String lastname;
}

class B {
 A field1;
 Boolean field2;
}
```


A function `JsonReader.jsonToJava(B.class, json);` should be able to serialize the JSON into an instance of class B, right?

And if instead the definition of class B looked like this:

```
class B {
 Object field1;
 Boolean field2;

"Add support methods for asserting common invariants
# Background
Many methods and constructors have some invariants (i.e. restrictions) on the values being passed to them. For example, an index is often non-negative whereas a power-of-two parameter is often limited to a value between 0 and 63. We should almost always check these invariants (.e.g `requireNonNull(param)`) as early as possible in public methods and assert the invariants (e.g. `assert param != null`) in private methods. This is of particular importance in cases where the parameter is used ""later"", for example, in a constructor, when passed on as a parameter to a thread or in a delegator.

# Current Support
Java (and core) provides some useful methods for asserting invariants of which the method `Object.requireNonNull()` is perhaps the most well-known. We can also annotate methods with `@NotNull` to state the API contract. There is an optimized `requireNonNull()` in core's own `ObjectsUtil` that is using the intrinsic method `obj.getClass()` (I think later versions of Java will do the equivalent with the regular `requireNonNull()` method).

# Proposed Additions
Support methods and annotations could be added in core as per below:

## Assertions
We could add methods such as:
* `Longs.requirePositive(val)`: Throws an `IllegalArgumentException` if val < 1
* `Longs.requireNonNegative(val)`: Throws an `IllegalArgumentException` if val < 0
* `Longs.require(val, between(0, 64))`: Throws an `IllegalArgumentException` if val < 0 or val > 63
* `Longs.requirePositive(val, MyRuntimeException::new)` Throws a `MyRuntimeException` if val < 1

## Annotations
We could add annotations such as:
* `@Positive`
* `@NonNegative`
* `@Between(0, 64)`

## Example
```
public interface ExcerptTailer ... {
    @NonNegative
    @Override
    long index();

    boolean moveToIndex(@NonNegative long index);
}
```
```
class StoreTailer implements ExcerptTailer ... {

    @Override
    public boolean moveToIndex(@NonNegative final long index) {
        throwExceptionIfClosed();
        requireNonNegative(index);
     
         ...   
    }
}
```

# Performance Impact
The JIT compiler will be able to remove redundant checking (e.g. null-checks) via in-lining in code paths. Asserting invariants early can in some cases be faster than asserting (or implicitly asserting them by use) later. There are cases where the performance will be affected negatively.

"We should make it explicit how many instances of utility classes we should expect to see which is 0 rather than making it indirectly with a private constructor which can be called from a nested class or reflection for example. There are many examples in our code and others where you get a constructor and call setAccessible(true) and this allows utility instances to be created via deserialization i.e. input.

"As described in one of my older blog posts (http://minborgsjavapot.blogspot.com/2015/01/enforcing-java-singletons-is-very-hard.html) it is actually possible to create spurious enum constants as well. So, I think the capability to create unwanted instances is there for both alternatives: Enum or utility class. However, I think this is of less importance. If a user wants to create an instance of a class that is not supposed to be created, then let them go ahead.

My argument for using utility classes (i.e. non-instantiable final classes with a private constructor) over Enums is purely based on API management. Adding a public Enum class will have the following adverse effects on the API:

A) It adds `extends Enum` to the class
A1) It adds `implements Serializable` to the class
A2) It adds a `implements Comparable` to the class
B) It adds a static `valueOf(tring)` method
C) It adds a static `valueOf(Class, String)` method
D) It adds a static `values()` method

Other issues:
Some users are confused when there is an Enum with zero elements.
Code completion in the IDE will be polluted with the non-related enum methods (B, C and D)
It adds some extra enum properties to the class definition

So, if we have N classes of Enum utility classes, then we will add an additional of N*3 methods to maintain when ensuring version compatibility. Also, there will be N different static methods doing the same thing (e.g. `Foo.valueOf(Class, String)`, `Bar.valueOf(Class, String)` etc)

A more stringent way of enforcing a no-instance-property would be to create utility classes like this:

```
public final class FooUtil {

    private FooUtil() {
        throw new UnsupportedOperationException();
    }

    public static int bar() {
        return 42;
    }

}

```
This has the advantage of not providing any unrelated API methods and (almost) guarantees that no instances are created. (Well,  there is always instrumentation, isn't it?)

I think utility classes in internal packages (not exposed in the public API) may or may not be Enums.",2021-02-05 14:46:29+00:00,as described in one of my older blog posts it is actually possible to create spurious enum constants as well so i think the capability to create unwanted instances is there for both alternatives enum or utility class however i think this is of less importance if a user wants to create an instance of a class that is not supposed to be created then let them go ahead my argument for using utility classes i e non instantiable final classes with a private constructor over enums is purely based on api management adding a public enum class will have the following adverse effects on the api a it adds to the class a1 it adds to the class a2 it adds a to the class b it adds a static method c it adds a static method d it adds a static method other issues some users are confused when there is an enum with zero elements code completion in the ide will be polluted with the non related enum methods b c and d it adds some extra enum properties to the class definition so if we have n classes of enum utility classes then we will add an additional of n 3 methods to maintain when ensuring version compatibility also there will be n different static methods doing the same thing e g etc a more stringent way of enforcing a no instance property would be to create utility classes like this this has the advantage of not providing any unrelated api methods and almost guarantees that no instances are created well there is always instrumentation isn t it i think utility classes in internal packages not exposed in the public api may or may not be enums,2021-02-05 14:46:29+00:00,Feature Development,0.15034656,0.12086176,0.11621428,0.13502176,0.13083321,0.111852795,0.12983419,0.10503543,before

This is because in FactoryBase.cs:535 there is code to close dockable

        public virtual void CloseDockable(IDockable dockable)

            if (dockable.OnClose())

            }
        }
```
however `dockable` here is `ActiveDockable` and `ActiveDockable` is `null`, because there is no dockable in the ToolDock. I am not sure what is expected way to fix it

"I would suggest something along these lines:

https://github.com/OpenHFT/Chronicle-Core/tree/feature/closeable/src/main/java/net/openhft/chronicle/core/resource

The `FooResource` is using a `ManagedResourceSupport` class to handle resource management. This means it is using something rather than being something. This provides better API control and also opens up for specialized support implementations that can be optimized (e.g. if no thread confinement is needed, a more optimized class can be supplied by the builder). 

There are many aspects to this and I am just showing a rough outline here.

I think these ideas could be realized in a new future core major version bump. In the short term, I would consider splitting up close and thread assertions into separate methods.

"Add a zero cost assertion mechanism
Normal assertions using the `assert` keyword have several drawbacks:

* It requires byte code space, thereby increasing code space
* Interpretation mode is slower because more code has to be interpreted
* Compile mode might be substantially slower because the inlining threshold will be consumed by assertion code
* It always produces the same kind of Error (i.e. AssertionError)
* Unless accompanied with an assert message, it provides little extra information as to which invariant did not hold (e.g. """" vs. ""The provided index was non-negative (=-3))

It is possible to write an equivalent assertion mechanism that solves all the above (i.e. with no impact on byte code size, interpreting, and compiled code performance). The drawback is that switching on assertions will be non-standard.

"Add events for when Dockables are activated/focused.
Hi,

In the project I am currently working on. I would like to be able to handle when the active/focused dockable changes/keep track of the current active one. There does not seem to be any events available for when the active/focused dockable changes. Perhaps an event and/or observable could be added to the `IFactory` interface or its implementers. 

I am not sure what the difference between focused and active is. Is there only one focused dockable but every dock can have an active dockable? So what I need may be a `FocusChanged` event instead. 

Something a long the lines of:

```C#
public event EventHandler<ActiveDockableChangedEventArgs> ActiveDockableChanged;
//And/Or
public event EventHandler<FocusedDockableChangedEventArgs> FocusedDockableChanged;
```

What I am trying to achieve for my project is:

```C#
public interface IShell
{
    IFactory Factory { get; }
    IRootDock Layout { get; }

    IDocument? ActiveDocument { get; }
    ReadOnlyObservableCollection<IDocument> Documents { get; }
    IObservable<IDocument?> DocumentActivated { get; }

    ITool? ActiveTool { get; }
    ReadOnlyObservableCollection<ITool> Tools { get; }
    IObservable<ITool?> ToolActivated { get; }

    void OpenDocument(IDocument document);
    void OpenDocument<TDocument>() where TDocument : IDocument;
    void OpenTool(ITool tool, bool focus = false);
    void OpenTool<TTool>(bool focus = false) where TTool : ITool;
}
```

"Closing HostWindow does not cause ""RemoveWindow"" to occur.
Hi,

Currently if you close the `HostWindow` no events are fired on the `Factory`. If you close all the dockables i.e. documents in a floating window then the `HostWindow` is closed and the `Factory.RemoveWindow` is executed. This seems like a bug to me.  Currently `HostWindow` is doing:

```
protected override void OnClosed(EventArgs e)
{
    base.OnClosed(e);
    Window?.Factory?.HostWindows.Remove(this);
}
```

Should it be doing:

```
protected override void OnClosed(EventArgs e)
{
    base.OnClosed(e);
    Window?.Factory?.HostWindows.Remove(this);
    Window?.Factory?.RemoveWindow(Window);
}
```

Ideally closing a `HostWindow` would check if it is OK to close. i.e. All dockables `OnClose` return true. Or at least an event I can handle myself. Not sure if handling the `Avalonia.Controls.Window.Closing` Event would suffice.

Thanks,
Daniel",2021-06-19 12:47:54+00:00,closing hostwindow does not cause removewindow to occur hi currently if you close the no events are fired on the if you close all the dockables i e documents in a floating window then the is closed and the is executed this seems like a bug to me currently is doing should it be doing ideally closing a would check if it is ok to close i e all dockables return true or at least an event i can handle myself not sure if handling the event would suffice thanks daniel,2021-06-19 12:47:54+00:00,Bug Fixing & Debugging,0.09841063,0.13742211,0.14710252,0.13074864,0.11983829,0.1158632,0.12731019,0.123304375,before

             ssh_config files or passed on the ssh(1) command-line),
             even if ssh-agent(1) or a PKCS11Provider or
             SecurityKeyProvider offers more identities.  The argument
             to this keyword must be yes or no (the default).  This
             option is intended for situations where ssh-agent offers
             many different identities.

"CommonInterruptible.interrupt incorrectly assumes it's being called from an interrupted thread
We replace the ""interruptor"" field on interruptible channels with an implementation that doesn't close the channel when interrupted https://github.com/OpenHFT/Chronicle-Core/blob/f5f12d4c0f1f0b803c861e8cd9d44bf31aa6aad4/src/main/java/net/openhft/chronicle/core/Jvm.java#L1372

One way `Interrubtible#interrupt` is called is when a thread is interrupting a second thread which is blocked in an IO operation. In this scenario `isInterrupted` of the calling thread can be (and probably usually is) false.

In Java 8: https://github.com/openjdk/jdk/blob/9a9add8825a040565051a09010b29b099c2e7d49/jdk/src/share/classes/java/lang/Thread.java#L910

"Remove the use of finalize()
Overriding `finalize()` introduces a number of drawbacks including (but not limited to) escape analysis of such objects will always fail, dead-locks, resurrections, memory leaks, and that the finalize task is run as a part of the GC process potentially prolonging GCs which is especially unpleasant during stop-the-world collections. Also, `finalize()` is deprecated in Java 9 and onwards.

It would be much better to introduce a Reference-based cleanup of objects that are unreachable.

Elaborations on drawbacks:

"DualReferenceCounted introduces risk of deadlock
`DualReferenceCounted` wraps an instance of `VanillaReferenceCounted` and one of `TracingReferenceCounted`, delegating all calls that change state (e.g. `reserve`/`release`/`releaseLast`) to both of them. These calls are made in synchronized blocks so as to ensure both child `ReferenceCounted` objects are called in sequence atomically.

This presents a number of issues, 
- If one of the calls fails, the two `ReferenceCounted`s can get out of sync (this currently happens if you called `releaseLast`, with a reference that isn't the last)
- The `onRelease` handler in the children are called in the synchronized block, [introducing the possibility of a deadlock](https://github.com/OpenHFT/Chronicle-Core/blob/e243bfa5095657d6e3ecc877a6302bec41f2c13e/src/main/java/net/openhft/chronicle/core/io/TracingReferenceCounted.java#L121)

[The addition of the ReferenceChangeHandler](https://github.com/OpenHFT/Chronicle-Core/pull/443) adds to this risk.

"String octal notation doesn't work

```bash
while :;do echo $LINES $COLUMNS $(( $RANDOM % $COLUMNS)) $(printf ""\U$(($RANDOM % 500))"");sleep 0.05;done|java -jar jawk.jar '{a[$3]=0;for (x in a){o=a[x];a[x]=a[x]+1;printf ""\033[%s;%sH\033[2;32m%s"",o,x,$4;printf ""\033[%s;%sH\033[1;37m%s\033[0;0H"",a[x],x,$4;if (a[x]>=$1){a[x]=0;}}}'

The problem is that the `\033` char (`ESC`, `27`, `0x1B`) in the AWK script is not compiled as the 27th ASCII char but simply as the `033` string (the backslash has been trimmed). This prevents the ANSI terminal control codes from working.

As you can see they have proliferated because sometimes to avoid a usage-collision, being thread-local is not enough. Indeed there have been a few bugs that have been the result of a thread using it's thread-local bytes in an outer scope, then the same thread over-writing it in an inner scope.

One way to mitigate this risk is for threads to take a lease on these resources and then return them once they're done with them. While the lease is being held the resource should not be available to any other nested scope.

The proposed pattern is:

```java

try (ScopedResource<Bytes<?>> stlBytes = Wires.acquireScopedBytes()) {
    // Use the bytes for whatever (we are holding an exclusive lease on it)
    Bytes<?> bytes = stlBytes.get();
    bytes.append(""Hello world: "");
    bytes.append(callSubMethodThatMightAlsoTryAndUseTheThreadLocal());
    valueOut.text(bytes);
} // <-- the bytes instance is returned to the ""pool"" and made available to other callers again
```

Following this approach would eliminate a class of errors, and worst-case, when the pool is not large enough, generate some garbage, though this should also generate a warning so the usage pattern can be reviewed.",2023-09-19 02:42:36+00:00,add scoped thread locals there is a pattern that is repeated in our code whereby we use singleton thread local resources to avoid creating garbage some examples include wires acquirebinarywire wires acquirebytes wires acquireanotherbytes wires acquirebytesfortostring wireinternal acquirestringbuilder wireinternal acquireanotherstringbuilder wireinternal acquirestringbuilderforvaluein wireinternal acquirestringbuilderforvalueout wireinternal acquireinternalbytes as you can see they have proliferated because sometimes to avoid a usage collision being thread local is not enough indeed there have been a few bugs that have been the result of a thread using it s thread local bytes in an outer scope then the same thread over writing it in an inner scope one way to mitigate this risk is for threads to take a lease on these resources and then return them once they re done with them while the lease is being held the resource should not be available to any other nested scope the proposed pattern is following this approach would eliminate a class of errors and worst case when the pool is not large enough generate some garbage though this should also generate a warning so the usage pattern can be reviewed,2023-09-19 02:42:36+00:00,Bug Fixing & Debugging,0.14062068,0.08325029,0.15084068,0.12903686,0.12860355,0.10905672,0.12552081,0.13307038,before

"Idea: Reified predicates.
An interesting Idea to pursue is the reification of attributes into first class data-structures.
One would insert tuples into each predicate individually and then combine them at query time.
```rust
const name = relation::with([(0, ""romeo""), (1, ""juliet""));
const loves = relation::with([(0, 1)]);

query!(
            ctx,
            (romeo, juliet, jname),

                    loves.has(romeo, juliet)))

"HostWindowTitleBar has a Foreground Brush not appropriate for Simple (Dark) theme.
Hi,

It seems like the `ControlTheme` for `HostWindowTitleBar` caters more for `FluentTheme` than `SimpleTheme`.  The current `ControlTheme` uses a foreground brush `SystemControlForegroundBaseHighBrush`, which is the same as the default `TitleBar` `FluentTheme`. But the default for the `SimpleTheme` is `ThemeForegroundBrush`. So currently on dark simple theme the buttons look like this:

![image](https://github.com/wieslawsoltes/Dock/assets/6070165/64b73661-7c8a-4a89-b4bc-768ce80cf928)

Not sure if it's worth creating whole separate `ControlTheme` for the simple theme. An easier fix (which I am currently using) is creating a `Style` to change it.

```xaml
<Style Selector=""dock|HostWindowTitleBar"">
  <Setter Property=""Foreground"" Value=""{DynamicResource ThemeForegroundBrush}"" />
</Style>
```

Could possibly just add that simple rule to `DockSimpleTheme.axaml`.

I am happy to do a PR with this or perhaps some other solution that you would prefer.

Thanks,

"Artifact on Maven Central doesn't specify Printf4J as a dependency
# Problem

When running code built with Maven and a dependency on Jawk (`org.sentrysoftware:jawk:3.0.00`), we get a `java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: org/sentrysoftware/printf4j/Printf4J`.

As a matter of fact, `jawk-3.0.00.pom` only includes these dependencies (see [evidence](https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/sentrysoftware/jawk/3.0.00/jawk-3.0.00.pom)):

```xml
<dependencies>
  <dependency>
    <groupId>com.github.stefanbirkner</groupId>
    <artifactId>system-rules</artifactId>
    <version>1.19.0</version>
    <scope>test</scope>
  </dependency>
  <dependency>
    <groupId>junit</groupId>
    <artifactId>junit</artifactId>

    <scope>test</scope>
    <exclusions>

        <groupId>org.hamcrest</groupId>
      </exclusion>
    </exclusions>
  </dependency>
</dependencies>
```

And no reference to Printf4J! So, when building a project with Jawk as a dependency, we don't get the transitive dependencies, notably no Printf4J.

# Specification

The problem comes from the `maven-shade-plugin` which creates `jawk-3.0.00-standalone.jar`. It also creates `dependency-reduced-pom.xml`, without the dependencies that have been included in the *über-jar*, and this alternate *pom* gets installed and deployed to the Maven repository! (instead of the original `pom.xml`)

We need to prevent `maven-shade-plugin` from creating this `dependency-reduced-pom.xml` with the [\<createDependencyReducedPom\>](https://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-shade-plugin/shade-mojo.html#createDependencyReducedPom) configuration option.

# Tests

Make sure the original `pom.xml` is installed during `mvn install`.

This is bad:

"Conversion from string to numbers doesn't follow POSIX specification
Scalar variables in AWK can be either string, number or... *strnum*. See [gawk's manual](https://www.gnu.org/savannah-checkouts/gnu/gawk/manual/gawk.html#Variable-Typing-and-Comparison-Expressions).

Conversion (especially in comparison and mathematical operations) is governed by these types as in the below table:

|       STRING   |       NUMERIC   |      STRNUM    |
|----------------|-----------------|-------------|

| STRNUM  |       string    |      numeric     |    numeric |

Jawk doesn't implement *strnum* and evaluates dynamically when to convert a `String` to a `Number`, and *vice versa*.

"-- is the argument that should stop the processing of further arguments for Jawk, and pass the rest as ARGV to the AWK script
Currently, the `-` (simple dash) argument is a special argument to signals to Jawk that the rest of the arguments in the command line should not be parsed, but be considered as inputs to the AWK script (or variables, etc.).

But POSIX requires `--` (double dash) to be this special argument. Simple dash means *stdin* as an input.

Also, gawk doesn't require `--`: the first ""unknown"" option passed as an argument is considered the end of the official gawk arguments, and the rest is considered as input files, variable assignments, and passed in `ARGV`.

"Fix vcpkg integration build failures
## Build System Issues

Multiple CI workflows are failing due to vcpkg integration problems:

### Affected Workflows
- Vcpkg CI
- C/C++ CI macOS
- C/C++ CI Ubuntu

### Symptoms
- Consistent failures across different platforms (macos-latest, ubuntu-latest)
- Pattern of vcpkg integration failures in recent workflow runs
- Build configuration failures rather than test execution failures

### Impact
- Affecting all PRs including #465
- Blocking CI/CD pipeline across different platforms

### Next Steps
1. Investigate vcpkg configuration in CI workflows
2. Review recent vcpkg integration changes
3. Address build system compatibility issues

This issue is separate from the modulo implementation changes in PR #465 and should be tracked independently to maintain clear separation of concerns.

"test_extrapolator fails with polynomial normalization error
## Issue Description
During CI builds, test_extrapolator is failing with a polynomial normalization error in Sum.cpp:1478.

### Error Message
```
Need normalized polynomial of f(v8) to get its coefficients
```

### Affected Platforms & Builds
- Windows (MSVC build)
- macOS
- macOS Vcpkg build
- (Pending verification on Windows Vcpkg/Conan builds)

### Build Status Pattern
✅ Passing:
- Ubuntu CI
- Docker CI
- Ubuntu Vcpkg

❌ Failing:
- Windows MSVC
- macOS
- macOS Vcpkg

### Analysis
- Error occurs in Sum.cpp line 1478
- Issue appears to be with polynomial normalization logic
- Not related to comparison operator changes
- Affects both Windows and macOS builds consistently
- Occurs across different build systems (native and Vcpkg)

### Next Steps
1. Investigate polynomial normalization logic in Sum.cpp
2. Review test_extrapolator's polynomial handling
3. Consider platform-specific differences in floating-point handling
4. Analyze build system differences between passing (Ubuntu/Docker) and failing platforms

"Compare alternative IF performance to implemented one
An alternative approach:

 lets describe mathematically this expression: ""if m=0 then a=1"" [ else a=a ]

Using mathematical notation, we can write this expression as:
            
if(m,a) = abs(sign(m))*a + (1 + sign(m))/2 * a
if(m,a) =  ((1 - m/|m|)/2 + (1 + m/|m|)/2) * a  

This expression uses the sign function, which returns -1 if m is negative, 0 if m is zero, and 1 if m is positive. If m is zero, the first term evaluates to 1/2 and the second term evaluates to a,
 so the expression simplifies to a = 1/2 + 1/2 * a, which yields a = 1.

"The source change that should take care of it, was the removal of the
""condition"" in ReflectionUtils that was preventing setAccessible(true) from
being called when it deem the item (Method, Field, Constructor) public.  As
it turns out, a public Field, Method, Constructor can still fail in a JPMS
and OSGi environment, so the conditional had to be removed. We have tests
now that will break if the ""isPublc()"" check is added to ReflectionUtils
and prevents setAccessible(true) from being called (on *public*) items.  It
seems counter intuitive, but it is related to module security.

"Rebrand Codebase from Sentry Software to MetricsHub
### Issue: Rebrand Codebase from Sentry Software to MetricsHub

**Description**
Following the organization change from *Sentry Software* to *MetricsHub*, the codebase needs to be updated to reflect the new naming convention. This includes adjusting package names, imports, and Maven configurations.

### Tasks  
- Update the `pom.xml` files:
  - Change `groupId` from `org.sentrysoftware` to `org.metricshub`.
  - Change the `artifactId` accordingly to repository name (lowercase) `jawk`.
  - Update the `parent` dependency to [latest MetricsHub OSS Parent available](https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/org.metricshub/oss-parent/overview).
  - Ensure artifact coordinates reflect the new organization.
  - Update the Organization to MetricsHub
- Update all Java package names from `org.sentrysoftware` to `org.metricshub`.
- Rename corresponding directories to match the new package structure.
- Adjust all `import` statements to reflect the new package names.
- Review and update any documentation mentioning *Sentry Software* (README, Javadoc, comments, etc.).
- Verify that the build and tests pass after these modifications.

### Additional Notes
- Ensure that any references in CI/CD configurations (GitHub Actions, Jenkins, etc.) are updated accordingly.
   - Change the `.github/workflows` files to redirect to [MetricsHub workflows](https://github.com/MetricsHub/workflows)
- If publishing artifacts to a repository (e.g., Maven Central, internal Nexus), verify that the updated coordinates comply with publishing requirements.

**Impact**

"### Why a “stuck - online” record is already very hard to hit

* **`onDisconnect()` lives on the server.**
  As soon as you attach `userStatusDbRef.onDisconnect().updateChildren(buildAway())`, that instruction is stored on the Realtime Database backend. When the TCP connection is lost—whether the app is killed, the phone dies, the user pulls the SIM, you name it—the server executes the write. It doesn’t matter that the client never got a chance to run more code – the server takes care of it for you. The Firebase docs explicitly call this out: *“These updates occur whether the client disconnects cleanly or not, so you can rely on them to clean up data even if… a client crashes.”* ([[firebase.google.com](https://firebase.google.com/docs/database/android/offline-capabilities)][1])

* **Foreground vs. background are both covered.**

  * **Foreground:** you keep the socket open (`goOnline()`), so a power-loss triggers `onDisconnect() → state=offline`.
  * **Background:** you already set `state=offline` before calling `goOffline()`. If the heartbeat never runs again nothing changes—the record is *already* offline.

* **“What if the write that registers `onDisconnect()` never reaches the server?”**
  In that case **`setUserOnline()` wouldn’t reach the server either**, so the user would never appear online to begin with. Nothing to clean up.

Because of these points, a zombie “online” status usually means either:

1. Your security rules rejected the `onDisconnect()` write.
2. Someone overwrote `/status/{uid}` from elsewhere in your code or database viewer.
3. A bug in the UI ignores `last_heartbeat` and shows stale data.

All three are easier to fix directly than by sweeping with a cron job.

---

### Still want a belt-and-suspenders check? Add a scheduled Cloud Function

If absolute certainty (or analytics on stale sessions) is valuable to you, a lightweight watchdog is fine. With 2nd-gen Cloud Functions you can run it every \~10 minutes and only pay a few cents:

```ts
import * as functions from 'firebase-functions/v2';
import * as admin from 'firebase-admin';

admin.initializeApp();

export const presenceWatchdog = functions.pubsub
  .schedule('every 10 minutes')   // cron-like syntax
  .onRun(async () => {
    const now = Date.now();
    const snap = await admin.database()
      .ref('status')
      .orderByChild('state').equalTo('online')
      .once('value');

    const updates: {[path: string]: any} = {};
    snap.forEach(child => {
      const { last_heartbeat } = child.val() ?? {};
      if (typeof last_heartbeat === 'number' &&
          now - last_heartbeat > 20 * 60 * 1000) {   // 20 min tolerance
        updates[`${child.key}/state`] = 'offline';
      }
    });

    return Object.keys(updates).length
      ? admin.database().ref('status').update(updates)
      : null;
  });
```

The scheduling API (`functions.pubsub.schedule('every 5 minutes') …`) is part of Firebase’s standard toolkit and is ultimately powered by Cloud Scheduler ([[firebase.google.com](https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/schedule-functions)][2]).

---

### A simpler alternative: trust the timestamp, not the flag

Even without a backend job you can eliminate most false-positives client-side:

```kotlin
val isReallyOnline =
    (user.state == ""online"") &&
    (System.currentTimeMillis() - user.last_heartbeat < 2 * 60 * 1000)
```

That way, if a record *ever* gets stuck, the UI silently degrades to “offline” after two minutes, independent of `state`.

---

## Recommendation

* **Keep your existing presence logic; it already follows Firebase’s best-practice pattern.**
* **Add the timestamp sanity-check in your UI**—it’s cheap protection and avoids extra backend costs.
* **Only add the scheduled Cloud Function** if you have regulatory or product requirements that demand server-side guarantees, or if you want metrics on abandoned sessions.

With those safeguards you’ll be covered even in the face of dead batteries, force-kills, and network gremlins—without turning a simple presence system into a mini-distributed-system of its own.

"## Algorithm for Calculating Logarithm of a Rational Number with Precision Check

**Input:**

* Rational number `r` represented as a pair of integers `(numerator, denominator)`.
* Required precision `epsilon`.

**Output:**

* Logarithm of `r` with a guaranteed precision of at least `epsilon`, or
* An indication that the required precision cannot be achieved within a reasonable computational limit.

**Algorithm:**

1. **Check for special cases:**
    * If `r` is 1, return 0.
    * If `r` is 0 or negative, return an error indicating invalid input.

2. **Convert `r` to a continued fraction:**
    * Use the Euclidean algorithm to find the continued fraction representation of `r`.
    * Store the continued fraction as a list of partial quotients `[a_0, a_1, a_2, ..., a_n]`.

3. **Calculate the logarithm using the continued fraction:**
    * Initialize `log_r = 0`.
    * Iterate through the partial quotients in reverse order (from `a_n` to `a_0`):
        * For each `a_i`:
            * Calculate `log_term = 2 * log_r / (2 * log_r + a_i)`.
            * Update `log_r = log_term`.
    * Multiply the final `log_r` by `pi` and divide by the square root of 6.

4. **Precision check:**
    * Calculate the difference between the calculated logarithm and the actual logarithm of `r` using a high-precision library function.
    * If the difference is less than or equal to `epsilon`, return the calculated logarithm.
    * Otherwise, return an indication that the required precision cannot be achieved.

**Explanation:**

This algorithm allow precision check to ensure that the calculated value meets the user's requirements.

**Additional Notes:**

"Investigate using XHRRequest instead of `ns.wget`

"Change `buy-servers` script into a service
Manually buying servers is fine for active play, but more and more as I get farther into the game I end up running the `buy-servers` script in `--wait` mode with a budget large enough to require minutes or hours between buying each server.

More importantly, working towards a fully automated Bitnode completion, we'll need to have a persistent service that buys or upgrades servers automatically.

Broadly speaking we want to buy new servers when:

- we have > 90% (or so) total RAM utilization
- and either:
  - we have valuable targets we could be hacking
  - we could be hacking our current targets at a higher percentage

When this is the case we want to buy (or upgrade) servers one at a time, at a rate proportional to our current income.

In particular, we want to avoid buying each size of server to be efficient with our money. The heuristic I've been working with manually is that each upgrade I buy should be at least 4x the previous size (skip 1 upgrade)  and preferably at least 8x (skip 2).

It also might be reasonable to base the desired buy size on the size of the home server.

What to look at | Why it matters
-- | --
Signing certificate | Always sign every debug, staging and production build with the same keystore when you’re testing OAuth flows.

ChatGPT said:

Thought for 1m 27s
The stack-trace isn’t coming from your code at all – it’s thrown inside the Firebase Auth Android SDK when it tries to pull a per-app encryption key out of the Android Keystore and the key it finds can no longer be decrypted.
The most common way that key corruption happens is:

Auto-backup restores the old key onto a “new” install

If android:allowBackup (enabled by default) or a custom android:fullBackupContent rule lets the Keystore metadata be backed-up, Android will restore that blob the next time the user re-installs or side-loads a build that’s signed with a different signing certificate (e.g. debug → release or CI build → local build).

The new build can’t decrypt the restored blob, so GenericIdpActivity throws
Failed to generate/retrieve public encryption key for Generic IDP flow.

You (or your tester) uninstall / reinstall frequently with different APKs
– same package name, different signing key – so the problem appears only “from time to time”.

Quick fix
Add the two attributes below to the <application> element of every flavour that ships to testers:

xml
Copy
Edit
<application
    android:allowBackup=""false""
    android:fullBackupContent=""false""
    ...>
Disabling backup prevents the broken key from being restored on future installs.

After you add the flag, uninstall the app once (to wipe the bad backup) and reinstall a fresh build.

People who already have the app in Google Play will get a clean upgrade; new installs will never back up the key again.

This simple manifest change is the solution recommended by multiple Firebase engineers and confirmed by devs who hit the same crash 
[Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/71995212/failed-to-generate-retrieve-public-encryption-key-for-recaptcha-flow)
.
The Android docs also note that android:allowBackup=""true"" is the default, so it must be explicitly disabled if you don’t want Auto Backup to run 
[Android Developers](https://developer.android.com/identity/data/autobackup?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
.

If you still need backups
If you rely on Auto-Backup for user data:

Keep android:allowBackup=""true"".

Provide a backup rules XML that excludes the internal keystore files (noBackupFiles/*) or any path where you write custom crypto material.

Or migrate to the new data-extraction rules (Android 12+) and mark those files with <exclude>.

Other things to check (usually not necessary once backup is off)
What to look at	Why it matters
Signing certificate	Always sign every debug, staging and production build with the same keystore when you’re testing OAuth flows.
SHA-1 / SHA-256 in Firebase console	A mismatched fingerprint will surface as auth/app-not-authorized, but double-check anyway.
SafetyNet / Play Integrity in App Check	Older projects created before 2022 sometimes require ticking the “I agree” box in App Check → SafetyNet / Play Integrity to avoid intermittent internal errors.

TL;DR
The crash isn’t your logic – it’s a stale encryption key that follows the app via Auto-Backup. Turn backup off (or exclude the key material), uninstall once, reinstall, and the signInWithProvider() flow will work consistently.

internal error has occurred failed to generate public encryption key for generic idp flow chatgpt said thought for 1m 27s the stack trace isn t coming from your code at all it s thrown inside the firebase auth android sdk when it tries to pull a per app encryption key out of the android keystore and the key it finds can no longer be decrypted the most common way that key corruption happens is backup restores the old key onto a new install if android allowbackup enabled by default or a custom android fullbackupcontent rule lets the keystore metadata be backed up android will restore that blob the next time the user re installs or side loads a build that s signed with a different signing certificate e g debug release or ci build local build the new build can t decrypt the restored blob so genericidpactivity throws failed to generate public encryption key for generic idp flow you or your tester uninstall reinstall frequently with different apks same package name different signing key so the problem appears only from time to time quick fix add the two attributes below to the application element of every flavour that ships to testers xml copy edit application android allowbackup false android fullbackupcontent false disabling backup prevents the broken key from being restored on future installs after you add the flag uninstall the app once to wipe the bad backup and reinstall a fresh build people who already have the app in google play will get a clean upgrade new installs will never back up the key again this simple manifest change is the solution recommended by multiple firebase engineers and confirmed by devs who hit the same crash stack overflow the android docs also note that android allowbackup true is the default so it must be explicitly disabled if you don t want backup to run android developers if you still need backups if you rely on backup for user data keep android allowbackup true provide a backup rules xml that excludes the internal keystore files nobackupfiles or any path where you write custom crypto material or migrate to the new data extraction rules android 12 and mark those files with exclude other things to check usually not necessary once backup is off what to look at why it matters signing certificate always sign every debug staging and production build with the same keystore when you re testing oauth flows sha 1 sha 256 in firebase console a mismatched fingerprint will surface as auth but double check anyway safetynet play integrity in app check older projects created before 2022 sometimes require ticking the i agree box in app check safetynet play integrity to avoid intermittent internal errors tl dr the crash isn t your logic it s a stale encryption key that follows the app via backup turn backup off or exclude the key material uninstall once reinstall and the signinwithprovider flow will work consistently sources,2025-08-05 16:00:29+00:00,Bug Fixing &

"FS with regular expression doesn't properly separate leading and trailing separators
## Problem

FS with regular expression doesn't properly separate leading and trailing separators

### Examples:

**with awk**:

```shell
$ echo '  a  b  c  d ' | awk 'BEGIN { FS = ""[ \t\n]+"" }
{ print $2 }'

a
```

**with Jawk**:

```shell
echo '  a  b  c  d ' | jawk 'BEGIN { FS = ""[ \t\n]+"" }
{ print $2 }'

b
```

## Specifications

Modify `org.metricshub.jawk.jrt.RegexTokenizer.RegexTokenizer(String, String)` to properly follow gawk and bwk's behavior.

"Improve config handling of more complex types
Currently the config utility for simple string and number values. However more complex values like bigint, or JSON objects get mangled by the `config.ts` script because it receives them on the command line as strings and then stores them into LocalStorage assuming they are the correct type and therefore stringifying the string value and preventing it from being deserialized correctly.

It would actually be simpler for the `config.ts` script to directly set the LocalStorage key as a string, then the `Config` instance would correctly deserialize the object.

Even better would be if we exposed a separate API in the `Config` base class to allow setting just the config keys named in the config spec.",2025-08-08 23:54:26+00:00,improve config handling of more complex types currently the config utility for simple string and number values however more complex values like bigint or json objects get mangled by the script because it receives them on the command line as strings and then stores them into localstorage assuming they are the correct type and therefore stringifying the string value and preventing it from being deserialized correctly it would actually be simpler for the script to directly set the localstorage key as a string then the instance would correctly deserialize the object even better would be if we exposed a separate api in the base class to allow setting just the config keys named in the config spec,2025-08-08 23:54:26+00:00,Deployment,0.15173376,0.117802285,0.095539734,0.15281034,0.11172936,0.11634853,0.1634577,0.09057831,after

"Support nested Config values
Similar to git config we could support a kind of 'table.key' syntax. This would reduce the total number of config items at the cost of making them harder to edit by hand.


Pros:

- provides namespacing for config values
- more obvious which configs work together
- lets us reduce duplication in naming for similar configs

Cons:

- Current config would need to be reworked to support it
- Substantial design change needed

Meh:

- harder to edit local storage manually

Design questions:

- Storage: JSON objects or new key naming scheme?
- API Design: nested field access or dotted config names?",2025-08-09 07:58:55+00:00,support nested config values similar to git config we could support a kind of table key syntax this would reduce the total number of config items at the cost of making them harder to edit by hand pros provides namespacing for config values more obvious which configs work together lets us reduce duplication in naming for similar configs cons current config would need to be reworked to support it substantial design change needed meh harder to edit local storage manually design questions storage json objects or new key naming scheme api design nested field access or dotted config names,2025-08-09 07:58:55+00:00,Deployment,0.14996158,0.11899359,0.07563709,0.11424648,0.12125774,0.13640517,0.1668828,0.116615556,after

"NS function dispatcher service
Corporation functions are crazy expensive RAM wise. My current setup scripts take the approach of script-chaining where each script runs one function and then spawns the next in the chain. This is very boilerplate heavy, especially since my standards for scripts have risen higher with autocomplete, flag parsing, usage messages etc. It's also quite brittle and just a pain in the ass to write scripts in that style.

It would be neat to set up a service that listens on a port and allows clients to dispatch expensive one-off NS commands they want to run.

Preliminary thoughts on how to make it RAM efficient without any RAM dodging hacks:

- Current static RAM checker ignores strings so we can safely specify the exact `NS` function to run as a string.
- We should be able to create a type that extracts all the keys from the NS interface as valid arguments!
- Could use a self-spawning architecture to reset dynamic RAM cost (invoke one command, then spawn self to reset RAM cost)
- Or, could dynamically create single use scripts from string concatenation that invoke that particular script. This method could even be an addition to the existing `launch` service

The first design would be slower and probably would want to have an interesting split-daemon structure where we run two invocations of it, one that does the spawning and one that receives and responds to messages. Could probably use a similar `Promise` chain that my terminal lock uses to communicate via a module level variable.

A nice-to-have feature of the client API would be if the type of the function could somehow provide autocomplete for the actual function arguments, that sounds like possibly a pipe-dream however.",2025-08-13 16:04:50+00:00,ns function dispatcher service corporation functions are crazy expensive ram wise my current setup scripts take the approach of script chaining where each script runs one function and then spawns the next in the chain this is very boilerplate heavy especially since my standards for scripts have risen higher with autocomplete flag parsing usage messages etc it s also quite brittle and just a pain in the ass to write scripts in that style it would be neat to set up a service that listens on a port and allows clients to dispatch expensive one off ns commands they want to run preliminary thoughts on how to make it ram efficient without any ram dodging hacks current static ram checker ignores strings so we can safely specify the exact function to run as a string we should be able to create a type that extracts all the keys from the ns interface as valid arguments could use a self spawning architecture to reset dynamic ram cost invoke one command then spawn self to reset ram cost or could dynamically create single use scripts from string concatenation that invoke that particular script this method could even be an addition to the existing service the first design would be slower and probably would want to have an interesting split daemon structure where we run two invocations of it one that does the spawning and one that receives and responds to messages could probably use a similar chain that my terminal lock uses to communicate via a module level variable a nice to have feature of the client api would be if the type of the function could somehow provide autocomplete for the actual function arguments that sounds like possibly a pipe dream however,2025-08-13 16:04:50+00:00,Feature Development,0.1961395,0.099419504,0.11288023,0.11783503,0.1413068,0.11178286,0.12585527,0.09478082,after

"Release chunks logic causes RAM overcommit
The harvest script uses a feature of the memory manager that no other script in the game does, the ability to relinquish chunks of memory back to the allocator.

Currently, the way that harvest does this is extremely naive and optimistic. As soon as it calculates that it needs fewer chunks, it sends a `ReleaseChunk` message to the allocator and then the allocator decides which chunks to remove from the allocation owned by that harvest script. The allocator then sends a message back to the harvest script that containing it's full `AllocationResult`.

This API is fundamentally flawed. Because the allocator is in control of which chunks are freed, the only way for the client to correctly utilize this API would be to ensure no scripts are running in any of it's memory chunks, then call the API, then restart the batch hacking process.

This is not a viable solution for how we want the Batch hacking system to function, continuously spawning batches to have continuously ending batches hacking a target.

For this to actually work, there needs to be another round-trip communication before the memory is actually freed. After the server designates which chunks to free (should only send that message instead of the entire allocation result), the client then actually ensures those chunks are no longer being used, _then_ it sends a message saying those chunks are actually free.

This is a lot more work and in the short term we should just remove the release chunks capability.",2025-08-16 08:53:26+00:00,release chunks logic causes ram overcommit the harvest script uses a feature of the memory manager that no other script in the game does the ability to relinquish chunks of memory back to the allocator currently the way that harvest does this is extremely naive and optimistic as soon as it calculates that it needs fewer chunks it sends a message to the allocator and then the allocator decides which chunks to remove from the allocation owned by that harvest script the allocator then sends a message back to the harvest script that containing it s full this api is fundamentally flawed because the allocator is in control of which chunks are freed the only way for the client to correctly utilize this api would be to ensure no scripts are running in any of it s memory chunks then call the api then restart the batch hacking process this is not a viable solution for how we want the batch hacking system to function continuously spawning batches to have continuously ending batches hacking a target for this to actually work there needs to be another round trip communication before the memory is actually freed after the server designates which chunks to free should only send that message instead of the entire allocation result the client then actually ensures those chunks are no longer being used then it sends a message saying those chunks are actually free this is a lot more work and in the short term we should just remove the release chunks capability,2025-08-16 08:53:26+00:00,Bug Fixing & Debugging,0.11354313,0.10308123,0.15314268,0.13337894,0.13278651,0.100979365,0.143407,0.11968109,after

"Make all communication protocols more type-safe
Currently we imply a relationship between the `MessageType` and `MessagePayload` but we can do better than that with the Typescript type system.

Currently, we define port protocol messages like this:


```ts
// util/client.ts
export type Message<Type, Payload> = [
    type: Type,
    requestId: string,
    payload: Payload,
];

// services/client/port.ts
import { Message as ClientMessage } from 'util/client';


export enum MessageType {
    PortRequest,
    PortRelease,
}

export interface PortRelease {
    port: number;
}

export type Payload = PortRelease | null;
export type Message = ClientMessage<MessageType, Payload>;
```

In this formulation, the only thing tying the `PortRelease` `MessageType` and `Payload` is that they have the same name, and the `null` in the `Payload` type isn't obviously related to the `PortRequest` type in any way.

Typescript let's us define type aliases with arbitrary types and explicit values are valid types. So we can define this messaging protocol more strictly using a discriminated union:


```ts
export enum MessageType {
    PortRequest,
    PortRelease,
}

export type PortRequestMessage = [
    type: MessageType.PortRequest,
    requestId: string,
    payload: null,
];

export type PortReleaseMessage = [
    type: MessageType.PortRelease,
    requestId: string,
    payload: PortRelease,
];

export interface PortRelease {
    port: number;
}

export type Message = PortRequestMessage | PortReleaseMessage;
```

This describes the actual message much more clearly, and provides better type checking for implementing the client. It would be nice if we could include the response type as well but I'm not sure how to do that.

The downside to this structure is that we can't define the `Message` type using a type alias and we would need to change the `Client` class to interact with the new `Message` type.",2025-08-18 02:14:10+00:00,make all communication protocols more type safe currently we imply a relationship between the and but we can do better than that with the typescript type system currently we define port protocol messages like this in this formulation the only thing tying the and is that they have the same name and the in the type isn t obviously related to the type in any way typescript let s us define type aliases with arbitrary types and explicit values are valid types so we can define this messaging protocol more strictly using a discriminated union this describes the actual message much more clearly and provides better type checking for implementing the client it would be nice if we could include the response type as well but i m not sure how to do that the downside to this structure is that we can t define the type using a type alias and we would need to change the class to interact with the new type,2025-08-18 02:14:10+00:00,Feature Development,0.1615785,0.12382697,0.11422536,0.11150088,0.118515745,0.12983002,0.11131695,0.12920561,after

"ItemsSource example from quick-start.md appears not to work
Probably I'm missing some bit of binding magic but I tried using the ""ItemsSource"" example from quick-start.md and just cannot get this to work,

I can workaround this (I think) using parent bindingl

``` 
<TextBox Text=""{Binding $parent.((vm:FileDocument)DataContext).Content}"" AcceptsReturn=""True"" />

----------------

The user was logged using facbook method and email should NOT be reuired, but the logc stills logoff user .

it shoudl check gacbookid instead. if it exist this means all is good.

Another issue is that after log off it tries to SoccerApp.setUserOnline: ❌ setUserOnline failed, which ofclourse failes because no user is logged. so it should make a check before calling SoccerApp.setUserOnline: ❌ setUserOnline failed if user is logged.

Then another method failes SoccerApp.forceUserOffline: ❌ could not mark offline again because user is not log in, so it should check first is user is logged in before invoking this method.",2025-08-23

There are 3 issues:

1. MenuActivity.runHousekeeping should not logout user because of missing email, because user is logged using facebook method. SO the menu activity should check login method. if login method is email OR google and email is missing or empty - it should log out user

if loginmethod is facbook and facbookid value or field is missing - it sgould logout user

and genearlly it should check if accountDeleted is true - it should log out user


2. it should not invoke SoccerApp.setUserOnline is user is not logged in

3. it should not invoke SoccerApp.forceUserOffline if user is not logged in.",2025-08-23 17:57:10+00:00,fix chec at initation see the logcat below process started 9919 for package piotr gorczynski

chatgpt suggests that

That silhouette means you’re asking Facebook for the photo without any access token (an anonymous request). If the user’s profile photo isn’t Public, the public endpoint falls back to the blank image.

Option B (guaranteed): fetch with the user’s access token

Right after Facebook login you have an access token. Use it once to resolve the real CDN URL, then cache it.

HTTP (no redirect):

GET https://graph.facebook.com/v20.0/{facebookId}/picture
    ?type=large
    &redirect=0
    &access_token={USER_ACCESS_TOKEN}


Response:

{ ""data"": { ""is_silhouette"": false, ""url"": ""https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/..."" } }

"Rebuild graft list after every install
The queue-graft script works well once we have enough money to install almost anything.

However, during bootstrapping a new Bitnode, it's likely we will have to initially settle for at least one or two lower-cost and lower-improvement augments before we can purchase the really high value augments.

But installing an augment takes long enough that we might earn enough money while installing it to buy a better one than we could have before we started (almost certainly in fact).

So before installing a new augmentation we should rebuild the list from the beginning, and choose the highest value one we can afford right now, rather than relying on a list built at the start of the script.

Also, we should devalue good augments that have a lot of pre-requisites before we have the violet congruity implant, because more pre-reqs means less improvement overall because the entropy virus will grow.

Finally, we should always prioritize installing the violet contgruity implant if we don't have it, no matter what type of augments we are interested in.",2025-08-24 12:48:45+00:00,rebuild graft list after every install the queue graft script works well once we have enough money to install almost anything however during bootstrapping a new bitnode it s likely we will have to initially settle for at least one or two lower cost and lower improvement augments before we can purchase the really high value augments but installing an augment takes long enough that we might earn enough money while installing it to buy a better one than we could have before we started almost certainly in fact so before installing a new augmentation we should rebuild the list from the beginning and choose the highest value one we can afford right now rather than relying on a list built at the start of the script also we should devalue good augments that have a lot of pre requisites before we have the violet congruity implant because more pre reqs means less improvement overall because the entropy virus will grow finally we should always prioritize installing the violet contgruity implant if we don t have it no matter what type of augments we are interested in,2025-08-24 12:48:45+00:00,Deployment,0.12450726,0.10485944,0.11049867,0.13757162,0.12419509,0.10778539,0.17166665,0.118915856,after
"Anonymous login
At the moment in the mobile/app/src/main/java/piotr_gorczynski/soccer2/UniversalLoginActivity.java we have 4 methods:
email
google
facebook

I have heard that firebase allows anonymous login. 

so providing that such method exists so i want to add 4th method - anonymous.

0. modify or add another step in gcp\cloud-build\deploy_firebase_with_auth.yaml to enable anonymous login
1. before creating anonmpus user it should provide a warning that ""The  anonymous user allows access to certain functions, but in case of (and here list the relevant cases like phone reinstalation, new phone, lost phone, or logoff which lead to loosing link to anonymous account on firebase) the link to anonymous user is lost and it is not possible to login to the same anonymopius account. do you want to proceed?""

Thgis message should be stored in strings and translated to all supported languages.
2. This shoudl creat new entry in authentication and methos anonoymous or relevant one and corresponding user in users collection with login method ""anonymous""
3. It should follow the same flow as other logins - ask user for Terms, COnsent, nickname
4.

"Link anonymous account with credentials
There is a method that user can login using anonymous method.

I have heard that there is functionality in firebase to 'convert' anonymous acount to reular account identfied by e.g. email, google or facebook.

Thefore i want you to add on mobile/app/src/main/java/piotr_gorczynski/soccer2/AccountActivity.java a buttion which will say something like ""Link to registered account"" (of course we need to transle it in strings to all supported languages) and will use linkWithCredential(...) function from firebase.

It shoudl show something like mobile/app/src/main/java/piotr_gorczynski/soccer2/UniversalLoginActivity.java, but without ANonymous option wnd when this login woul d succed, the existing account should be converted to the one with email google or facebook credentails. 

Of course the former document in users/uid should be updated accordingly as with  email or google or facbook data as in normal flow.


My only concern is what will happen if user will already poses registered account with lets say uid=1 and then he will register anonaymous account with uid=2, and then he will try to link anonymous account uid=2 with registered account with uid=1. That would reuire smart merging of all the data.

interface no matter what screen we have open, and allow us to manage
scripts more flexibly.

---

## Motivation

As I use my terminal automation utility more, I’ve found it useful to
keep terminal automation scripts running most of the time,
particularly for intelligence grinding.  Right now I often end up
killing that script just to run one or two scripts for testing and
then restarting it again. This is precisely what the `launch` script
is designed to solve—but its ergonomics are a bit awkward.

A custom shell embedded in a script’s log/tail window could provide:
- Seamless launching of scripts through the memory allocator and `launch` service
- A less opinionated approach to argument parsing
- A smoother workflow for quick ad-hoc automation and testing
- The ability to build automation pipelines using shell-like syntax

---

## Features

- Custom shell prompt interface in a script tail window
- Argument parsing under our control (no forced quirks from Bitburner’s terminal)
- Input/output piping with Netscript Ports
- Waiting for processes to exit (`fg`/`bg` commands, `&` suffix)
- Command chaining with `&&` and `||`
- Built-in implementations of basic shell utilities (inspired by Phil Nelson’s minishell assignments), and as a bonus they would work across *all* hosts
- Shell scripting (`if`, `while`) for lightweight automation (stretch goal)

---

## Autocomplete

Autocomplete is one of the trickiest parts without the upcoming `dynamicImport` API in Bitburner 3.0.

Possible interim approach:
- Dynamically generate a helper script that statically imports the script the user is launching
- Run it with `ramOverride` since we only need the autocomplete function
- Communicate with that helper via ports/channels to get completion results

This will become *much* simpler with `dynamicImport` in 3.0.

---

## Advantages

- Cleaner and less awkward usage compared to invoking `launch` directly
- Argument parsing can be made more flexible and intuitive
- Ability to quickly chain together commands for trivial ad-hoc automation
- Consistent environment regardless of which host we’re on

---

## Disadvantages

- A lot of work to implement
- Bitburner terminal commands might need to be reimplemented in
  Javascript to be able to use
- Autocomplete will require some hacky workarounds until 3.0",2025-08-27 00:06:04+00:00,create a custom mini shell script we could implement a more full featured custom shell on top of our service this would give us access to a terminal like interface no matter what screen we have open and allow us to manage scripts more flexibly motivation as i use my terminal automation utility more i ve found it useful to keep terminal automation scripts running most of the time particularly for intelligence grinding right now i often end up killing that script just to run one or two scripts for testing and then restarting it again this is precisely what the script is designed to solve but its ergonomics are a bit awkward a custom shell embedded in a script s log window could provide seamless launching of scripts through the memory allocator and service a less opinionated approach to argument parsing a smoother workflow for quick ad hoc automation and testing the ability to build automation pipelines using shell like syntax features custom shell prompt interface in a script tail window argument parsing under our control no forced quirks from bitburner s terminal input piping with netscript ports waiting for processes to exit commands suffix command chaining with and built in implementations of basic shell utilities inspired by phil nelson s minishell assignments and as a bonus they would work across all hosts shell scripting for lightweight automation stretch goal autocomplete autocomplete is one of the trickiest parts without the upcoming api in bitburner 3 0 possible interim approach dynamically generate a helper script that statically imports the script the user is launching run it with since we only need the autocomplete function communicate with that helper via ports to get completion results this will become much simpler with in 3 0 advantages cleaner and less awkward usage compared to invoking directly argument parsing can be made more flexible and intuitive ability to quickly chain together commands for trivial ad hoc automation consistent environment regardless of which host we re on disadvantages a lot of work to implement bitburner terminal commands might need to be reimplemented in javascript to be able to use autocomplete will require some hacky workarounds until 3 0,2025-08-27 00:06:04+00:00,Feature Development,0.19693902,0.09326293,0.09171362,0.1336887,0.11336999,0.12737799,0.13527456,0.1083732,after
"New Features
i have old version 3.0 of soccer which just allowed to play alone.

on 6th of AUgust the version 7.0 of soccer introduced mulitplayer.
on 16th of ausgust the version 8.0 introduced mulitlingual (9 languages includening pakistan, nepali, urdu, hindu, etc)



but althogh the 1st muliplaye version was launch alomost 3 weeks ago (on 6th of august) and the stast look like this as attached, NO SINGLE  user registered.

I have one tournament open and there is NOBODY to play in the tournament.

i am ready to launch version 9.0 which introduces login via facebook and login via anonymous if sombody doesnt want to reveal his credentilas.

what would you suggest to introduce in this version in order to probe/check the users of version 8.0 and 7.0 - almost 1500 users - whay they do not want to register and participate in tournament?

You don’t need more features to “guess.” Ship v9.0 with measurement + tiny in-app research so you learn why people aren’t signing up and fix the friction fast.

What to add in v9.0 (focused + low effort)

Instrument the auth & tournament funnels (GA4)

Log the recommended GA4 events for auth:

login (when they open the sign-in sheet)

sign_up with method = google|email|facebook|anonymous (on success)

sign_up_error (custom) with params code, message, step (on failure/cancel).
GA4 recommended events & how to log events on Android: 
[Google for Developers](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/ga4/reference/events?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
[Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/docs/analytics/events?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

Add custom steps for your core flow:

tournament_view → tournament_join_start → tournament_join_success|tournament_join_error

In GA4 build a Funnel exploration for these steps to see exactly where users drop. 
[Google Help](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/9327974?hl=en&utm_source=chatgpt.com)

One-tap “Why not register?” intercept (2 buttons)

When a user dismisses the sign-up sheet or tries to join a tournament while not signed in, show a small bottom sheet:

Title: “Play without account?”

Buttons (each logs signup_decline_reason): just_playing_offline, privacy_concerns, too_complicated, don’t_use_google/email, other.

Keep it one tap (no text input). The event gives you immediate, language-segmented reasons (GA4 already tracks device language). Audiences & user properties let you segment later. 
Firebase
+1

Anonymous play as default → offer linking later

Let users start online as guest (Firebase Anonymous Auth). When they win a match, try to join a tournament, or choose a nickname, prompt: “Save your progress & nickname” and link the anonymous account to Google/Facebook/email. This preserves their stats & nickname. 
[Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/android/anonymous-auth?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

In-App Message (no push permissions needed) to v7/v8 users

Target an audience: App version is 7 or 8 AND not signed up after 2+ sessions. Show a small card explaining benefits + “Register” CTA, and A/B test the copy. In-App Messaging + targeting via Analytics audiences. 
Firebase
+1

A/B test the registration moment & copy (Remote Config)

Remote-config a param like signup_prompt_variant with variants:

on_open, after_first_online_click, after_1_match, only_when_joining_tournament

Also test copy: “Save nickname & ranking” vs “Play tournaments & global ladder.” Use Firebase A/B Testing on Remote Config. 
Firebase
+1

Verify there isn’t a hidden crash or error

Add Crashlytics breadcrumbs around auth and tournament screens and record the auth exceptions you already saw earlier. This will surface silent failures blocking sign-up. 
Firebase
+1

Minimal code you can drop in (Java)

Log a successful sign-up (GA4 recommended event):

FirebaseAnalytics fa = FirebaseAnalytics.getInstance(context);
Bundle p = new Bundle();
p.putString(FirebaseAnalytics.Param.METHOD, ""facebook""); // google|email|anonymous
fa.logEvent(FirebaseAnalytics.Event.SIGN_UP, p);


Log a decline reason:

Bundle r = new Bundle();
r.putString(""reason"", ""privacy_concerns""); // just_playing_offline|too_complicated|dont_use_google_email|other
fa.logEvent(""signup_decline_reason"", r);


Log a tournament funnel step:

Bundle t = new Bundle();
t.putString(""tournament_id"", tournamentId);
fa.logEvent(""tournament_join_start"", t);


(Then use GA4 Funnel exploration to analyze drop-offs.)

"Unexpected NumberFormatException logs for environment variable keys
### Specifications 

When Jawk loads the special ENVIRON array with system environment variables on Windows, it tries to parse every key as a number inside AssocArray.put()/remove().

For non-numeric keys such as USERNAME, PROCESSOR_LEVEL, or SESSIONNAME, this produces unnecessary NumberFormatException messages logged as “Key parse failure” (see attached screenshot).

This behavior is misleading, pollutes the logs, and is not compliant with AWK semantics, since associative array keys can be strings.

"Add a service monitor
The only reason that I keep a tail window open for things like kataPlay, task selector, queue-args etc. is so I know that they are running.

One of the downsides of the new automation scripts that respect the regular player focus setting when changing tasks is that there is no indicator that a script is running and to kill it you need to either force an error or find the script and kill it.

Instead of this ridiculous situation, it would probably be good to have a single service daemon that essentially does a filtered `ps` and shows the locations of important running scripts other than batch hacking scripts like till/sow/harvest and h/g/w.

We could display important things like:

- script name (with link to open tail)
- host
- ram usage
- runtime

A nice-to-have enhancement would be to categorize scripts by any resources they, the most important of which is probably player focus.",2025-08-28 10:51:38+00:00,add a service monitor the only reason that i keep a tail window open for things like kataplay task selector queue args etc is so i know that they are running one of the downsides of the new automation scripts that respect the regular player focus setting when changing tasks is that there is no indicator that a script is running and to kill it you need to either force an error or find the script and kill it instead of this ridiculous situation it would probably be good to have a single service daemon that essentially does a filtered and shows the locations of important running scripts other than batch hacking scripts like till and h we could display important things like script name with link to open tail host ram usage runtime a nice to have enhancement would be to categorize scripts by any resources they the most important of which is probably player focus,2025-08-28 10:51:38+00:00,Feature Development,0.17310615,0.09906311,0.10261961,0.14045483,0.12269761,0.120758265,0.11644334,0.12485705,after

Player action is a limited resource similar to running commands in the terminal.

We should create a promise based mutex to keep multiple scripts that want to set the player to an action from fighting or chaotically overriding each other.

"Improvements to new Protocol Layer
I'm happy with the client side utilities I've defined already, but the server side support seems to be quite lacking again. In particular, I would like to change the handlers so that they don't need to worry about sending responses at all.

Gemini analysis from Firebase Crashlitycs is following

The BadTokenException with the message ""Unable to add window -- token android.os.BinderProxy@5b9b1d2 is not valid; is your activity running?"" indicates that the application is trying to display a window (like a Dialog , Toast , Snackbar , or a custom view added to WindowManager ) using a window token that is no longer valid.
Cause of the Issue:
A window token is typically tied to the lifecycle of an Activity or a Service . When an Activity is destroyed or no longer in the foreground, its associated window token becomes invalid. If the application attempts to show a window using this invalid token, the BadTokenException is thrown.
In this specific case, piotr_gorczynski.soccer2.InAppMessagingHelper.showVersionTargetedMessage is likely attempting to display some form of in-app message. If this method is called after the Activity that provided the context for the window token has been destroyed or put in the background, the exception occurs. This often happens in asynchronous operations where a callback tries to display UI elements after the original UI context is gone.
Debugging and Resolution:
Identify the UI Element Being Displayed:
Examine the showVersionTargetedMessage method within InAppMessagingHelper.java . Determine exactly what UI element it is attempting to display (e.g., AlertDialog , Toast , Snackbar , PopupWindow , or a custom View added via WindowManager ).
Trace the Call to showVersionTargetedMessage :
Find all locations in your codebase where showVersionTargetedMessage is called.
Investigate the lifecycle state of the Activity (or Context ) that is passed to this method or used internally by InAppMessagingHelper at the time of the call.
Reproduce the Crash (if not easily reproducible):
If the crash is intermittent, try to simulate scenarios where an Activity is quickly destroyed or backgrounded while showVersionTargetedMessage might be pending execution. Examples:
Navigating away from an Activity rapidly.
Pressing the back button.
Rotating the device (which destroys and recreates the Activity ).
Moving the app to the background and then bringing it back to the foreground.
Actionable Next Step:
Implement lifecycle-aware UI updates. Before attempting to show any UI element, check if the associated Activity is still active and not finishing.
Best Practices to Avoid This Issue:
Use Activity.isFinishing() or Activity.isDestroyed() : Before displaying any UI element that requires an Activity context, always check if the Activity is finishing or has been destroyed.
// Example for a Dialog
if (activity != null && !activity.isFinishing() && !activity.isDestroyed()) {
    // Show the dialog
    dialog.show();
}
Expand
Apply this check within or around the showVersionTargetedMessage method. If InAppMessagingHelper takes a Context , ensure it's an Activity context when UI elements are being displayed, and perform the check.
Leverage AndroidX Lifecycle Components: If you're using AndroidX, you can make your UI updates lifecycle-aware by observing the Lifecycle of an Activity or Fragment . This is particularly useful for asynchronous operations.
Pass a LifecycleOwner (like an Activity or Fragment ) to your helper class.
Register a LifecycleObserver in your helper class or within a LiveData observer.
// In your Activity/Fragment:
InAppMessagingHelper.getInstance().showVersionTargetedMessage(this, getLifecycle());

// In InAppMessagingHelper:
public void showVersionTargetedMessage(Context context, Lifecycle lifecycle) {
    if (lifecycle.getCurrentState().isAtLeast(Lifecycle.State.RESUMED)) {
        // Or AT_LEAST_STARTED, depending on when you want to show it.
        // Ensure the context is an Activity
        if (context instanceof Activity) {
            Activity activity = (Activity) context;
            if (!activity.isFinishing() && !activity.isDestroyed()) {
                // Show your message (e.g., dialog.show())
            }
        }
    } else {
        // Defer the message or cancel if the state is not suitable.
        // Example: Add a LifecycleObserver to show it when RESUMED.
        lifecycle.addObserver(new LifecycleObserver() {
            @OnLifecycleEvent(Lifecycle.Event.ON_RESUME)
            public void onResume() {
                if (context instanceof Activity) {
                    Activity activity = (Activity) context;
                    if (!activity.isFinishing() && !activity.isDestroyed()) {
                        // Show your message
                    }
                }
                lifecycle.removeObserver(this); // Remove once shown or if no longer needed
            }
        });
    }
}

Handle Asynchronous Callbacks: If showVersionTargetedMessage is called from an asynchronous callback (e.g., network response, timer), ensure the context is still valid at the time the callback executes . The lifecycle-aware approach is the most robust solution for this.
Use Application Context (for certain UI elements): For Toast messages, you can often use Application context instead of Activity context. However, this is generally not suitable for Dialogs or complex views that require a theme or specific window management, as they need an Activity context. Using Application context for a Dialog will likely lead to a different BadTokenException or visual inconsistencies. In this case, InAppMessagingHelper is probably trying to show something more complex than a Toast .",2025-09-02 08:16:40+00:00,crashes on production after release 11 was published on production a

"Consent fix
Google Analytics is showing following information:

Consent missing for EEA users
Your Google Analytics for Firebase SDK isn’t sending consent information from end users in the European Economic Area (EEA), which may impact ads personalisation and measurement. To fix this, set up consent mode.

Codex suggested:

You’ll need to update your application code, not Google Analytics settings.

Google Analytics for Firebase expects the app to send explicit consent information for EEA users. Currently, your app isn’t supplying it, so Analytics can’t personalize or measure ads.

What to do:

Integrate a consent-gathering flow (e.g., Google’s User Messaging Platform or your own CMP).

Once the user responds, call the Firebase Analytics consent APIs to pass their choice (e.g., setConsent or setAnalyticsCollectionEnabled).

For web, you’d use gtag or Google Tag Manager to set analytics_storage, ad_storage, etc., after consent is known. For mobile apps, use the appropriate Firebase SDK methods.

There’s no toggle in the Google Analytics UI that resolves this—it must be handled in code so EEA users’ consent is collected and sent before Analytics/Ads functionality is enabled.

"Consider how to make Discover subscriptions more type-safe
The change to defining the basic sending messages entirely inside `defineProtocol` means that the Discover service needs to manually construct and send request envelopes and they are completely unchecked on the client side.

This works but is a clear end-run around the type-safety and security we've built with the protocol abstraction, and it would be nice to do this more cleanly.

One possibility, since I think it should be possible to read from multiple ports as long as we don't race `port.nextWrite` promises against each other. We could change the way Discover subscriptions work.

There could be some kind of well-known port where Discover publishes the known worker and target hosts.

This could be as simple as a port for each type, and the Discover service writes the list of all hosts of that type as a message. Then consumers can read the current list there, and receive updates when the list changes. The Discover service would pop the current message from the queue after writing an updated message each time.

Or we could build some kind of pub-sub abstraction? Or we could use Sodium streams?

"Create a custom shell to run in launch service daemon UI
As I'm using my terminal automation utility more, I'm finding that it's quite useful to have something automatic happening in the terminal most of the time. I often find myself killing that script just to run a single script or two for testing or similar and then restarting it. This is precisely what my launch script is for though.

I originally wanted to add a ""higher-order"" shell command to launch scripts with my launcher service, but I stalled out on trying to get seamless usage of the autocomplete API.

If we implemented a custom terminal in the log view of our launcher script we could do argument parsing how we want to and potentially provide a better autocomplete experience.

We could also reimplement a bunch of the basic shell utilities as builtins, and as a bonus make them work across all hosts!

For most things I could basically follow Phil Nelson's minishell assignments.

## Autocomplete

Without the `dynamicImport` API coming in 3.0 autocomplete will be annoying to implement. But we can probably hack it together. Something like:
 - dynamically generate a script that statically imports the script the user is launching
 - exec that script with `ramOverride` because we only import the autocomplete function
 - communicate with the generated script via ports/channels to get autocompletion results from the function

Which will all be much, much simpler in 3.0.

"Create a logging-facade + React UI utility
The logging side panel that Codex created for me for the memory allocator service is useful but now that we render React components once and then update their state, we can do a lot better.

In particular, we can create a page flip thing where we have the default view be the custom UI and have a toggle button in the corner that let's the user switch to the log view.

Stretch version would include supporting displaying logs side-by-side or in the button selected ""tab view"" mode, both by default in the API and at runtime by the user.

"Refactors before switching to channels
To make this hard change easier:

- [ ] Hide port usage, push channel allocation inside `BaseServer` and `BaseClient` constructors.
- [ ] Refactor port consuming loops to happen in one method (`awaxt nextWrite` & `for all messages`)
  * [ ] `BaseServer`
  * [ ] `GrowableMemoryClient`
  * [ ] `DispatchServer`
- [ ] Split refactor into two parts
  * [ ] Switch from `NetscriptPort` to `Channel`
  * [ ] Switch from request/response Ports and message IDs to individual ports for responses???
- [ ] Refactor `DispatchServer` to be restarted by `DispatchSupervisor`
- [ ] Make `DispatchServer` have some form of persistent ID assigned by `DispatchSupervisor`


First we want to minimize the number of places that a `NetscriptPort` appears in a public API.

For the loop refactor, we want to more closely model how looping over a channel works. Have one function for doing the looping, one function for processing a single message from the channel.

Finally, we need to make the dispatch script more robust in the face of not being able to leave messages on the port until it's ready to deal with them, and in general it needs to be able to have multiple instances of the server running at the same time without stepping on each other's toes.

"Maybe we want the `DispatchSupervisor` to act like a traffic router as well then? While trying to switch from using `NetscriptPort` to our new `Channel` API I ran into an interesting consequence of not having a `peek` method on the channel.

If we don't have a peek method, then we need to store messages that have been popped from the queue that we can't handle. But this becomes another shared queue, now with a peek method. If all `DispatchServer` instances are prioritizing reading from it, then one large RAM request could cause all of them to restart in rapid succession as they each try to read it from the queue.

Multiple consumers is actually kind of a hard problem!

So instead, maybe what we need to do is shift the problem. If we made the `DispatchSupervisor`, (or perhaps a third component, `DispatchLoadBalancer`?) responsible for reading from the queue and then forwarding the message to the appropriate `DispatchServer` instance, then this script could hold a queue for each `DispatchServer` instance and send a restart message on the channel it holds to communicate with that instance.

"Consider how to make channel usage safer for Netscript scripts
Writing Netscript scripts that do async things and properly shutdown when the ""script"" is ""killed"" is tricky, and the further away from using Netscript APIs you go, the murkier the waters get.

Netscript Ports are already a bit of a pitfall in regards to leaving scripts potentially hanging as I saw when implementing my dispatch server.

My new async `Channel` class might have serious problems with presenting an ergonomic API and also not leaking a bunch of memory/tasks when scripts are shutdown.

Consider a relatively straightforward scenario of a daemon script reading from it's channel. In order to actually stop the reading loop the server will need to create an `AbortController` and register an `ns.atExit` callback that signals abort and pass this signal in to the `Channel.readAll` method.

I could include a wrapper method that does that, but now I'm bring an NS API into the mix.

The same thing is true for any script that wants to block on writing to a `Channel`. Thats' a lot of boilerplate if I include it everywhere, or writing wrapper methods, or including the `nsAtExitFixture` in the channel tests and baking it into the API.

The last option is definitely the most ergonomic option from the consumer perspective and it doesn't really make sense to create a channel class and then immediately create a netscript wrapper for it when I'm not trying to create a general-purpose library.

Should I even be creating my own channel class in the first place? Is that really what I want to be writing?

"Figure out how to handle closed channels in the ports map
The idea of closing a channel is very foreign to code working with NetscriptPorts because they simply cannot ever be closed.

This makes sense from a lot of perspectives. Ports are a global resource accessed by index, a closed port in the global index is... what? just dead forever? That doesn't make sense.

When should you close a port, when the script exits? But you're probably just going to restart that script with a newer version. If you don't want to receive stale messages you just run clear and empty the buffer.

The idea of truly async ports sounded fantastic at first, but the deeper I go down this rabbithole, the more I realize I'm in Wonderland and the Javascript VM is a truly strange beast that I only barely grasp the barest hints of.

"Change startup to be more modular and based on Sodium Streams
Always start the core services like memory, port, launcher and reset info (replace source-file service).

Other services should be started on-demand by registering a script launch command. These script launching commands should include the script name, optional launch options, and a set of source file level dependencies. Or, perhaps we could write another script scanner function like the dependency gatherer to determine which NS APIs the script uses and thus what source files (or levels) it requires.

Actually, we want to be able to register multiple scripts, or perhaps the same script with different arguments and dynamic RAM settings to turn off usage of any features which aren't available.

"Sodium based message protocol
Wild half-asleep idea for how to structure a buffering protocol using Sodium `Stream` and `Cell`. Sending a message is sending to a published Sodium `Stream` somehow (`StreamSink`?). This `Stream` accumulates into a `Cell<Immutable.List<Message>>`.

The ""server"" daemon drains the buffer via sending an event that snapshots the message `Cell`, and updates the Cell to a new empty list. This event will ""carry"" the current buffer of messages to the listener in the server for it to process.

For performance we could treat this as a single abstraction implemented by two cooperating cells, like the amortized fast queue implementation done with two stacks (head and tail). When the head stack is empty, you flip the tail stack over into the head stack. In our case, using immutable-js persistent data structures we can implement the tail with an `Immutable.List`, and the tail is a `Immutable.Seq` over the previous tail. This could be inefficient if it's one message at a time, maybe? Need to benchmark or something?

This would allow for sending messages to a service before it is started, similar to how we can with `NetscriptPort`s.

"Sodium ApiCell caches data for too long
Since the `Cell` essentially caches data in memory indefinitely, when we do things like install augmentations, soft reset or finish a Bitnode these caches will become out of date. Currently, the start script is failing because the Discovery service values are cached and the cache is never cleared.

We can add a method to clear this cached value, and we can clear the cache when the provider script starts, however this feels a bit like going in the wrong direction.

Another possibility might be to create a Sodium proxy for the NS API. These wrappers could send events to public Streams.

"Historical invites
In the pending invites screen there are shown only active invites.

I want you to add on the same screen , below active invites a label saying Past invites and below should be all past invites shown with the status, whether they were accepted, cancelled or expired. They should have a button with label Invite and add to Friends, the button Invite and Add to Friend should be only enabled if the user who sent invite is not deleted. In addition Invite can be only enabled if user who sent invite is not offline.

Fir reference you can reuse functionality which is in friend list activity and add friend activity.

So in the past invites it should be also good to show when last heart of the user was, and list should be sorted  from the latest heart beats to the earliest, the same as in friends list activity

"Config Freeze
Switching to a new Bitburner app instance or browser means that I lose the LocalStorage configs I've tuned. Trying to diff the config and copy it over is silly, so it would be nice if there was a facility to save the current config as a file, and then reload it in a new browser. Since the file will be saved as part of the Bitburner save export this would allow nicely transferring to the new machine.

"Best user experience for showing hand
in #744 we added hand and it works perfectly.

Now i am thinking about best user experience to show such guidance.

Maybe w e caan show dialog after 3 cycles with the following message ""do uou still want me to show you possible moves? You can always tuni it off and on in Setings""

if user answers yes, then increase number of cycles to 10 and then ask again, if user still sya yes, ask again after 20 cycles. Remener that this counter must be kept outside the games, because gmes might finish earlier.

If user say no., stop showing the hand and remeber thsi choise in settings.

SO in seeting add additional menu posistion like ""SHow with hand possible moves"" and by defauly it should be ON, when application starts.

but the way the gcp\cloud-build\deploy_check_nickname.yaml deploys function causes, that i found that the function is using  491861032786-compute@developer.gserviceaccount.com 


in order to get this name i tested and in gcli this works:

admin_@cloudshell:~ (soccer-dev-1744877837)$ gcloud run services describe checknickname     --region us-central1     --format 'value(spec.template.spec.serviceAccountName)'
491861032786-compute@developer.gserviceaccount.com

"cleanup-inactive-users
THe firebase\functions\cleanup-inactive-users has the logic that it is skipping users who accepted terms.

MOdify this logic in such way, that the algorithm is not skipping such users, but forking into following scenarios:

IF in users field fcmErrorType=""NotRegistered"" then 
{
  if user logged with method anonymous then 
  {
    algorithm should do the same check which is doing for users who did not accepted terms, ie, check invites,    tournaments, friends, etc. and if the users {uid} is in non of these collections, then user can be deleted. If not, just write that user ecists in certain colletion and provide document {uid} in which he exists
  }
  else
  {
  algorithm should just force do user to logoff by marking his state ""state"",          ""offline"" in rtdb.

"cleanup-inactive-users
IN last #815 we modified firebase\functions\cleanup-inactive-users

See the example log below. It in the cal to function that user can be deleted it should check existence of the user in the friends collesions before it logs to consol ""CAN be safely deleted"". if user exists in some friends collection it should report - user exist in firend colledion of user {uid} and exit deletion process.


The second thing is to make the the describtion of removal of user from authentication more readable , because at the moemnt is says: 005tw0mjjvhq] 🔐 Deleted from Auth: undefined. WHat does it mean 'undefined'?

"Fix animation
IN last #861 we fixed logging of moves, but it gives incorrect values, see the log below, it seems that redsprite, bluesprite and ball has exacly the same x, y, which is wrong - they do not overlap each other!

SO because it is not correctly calulated i ask you to drop calulation of enter x, y which was introduced only for logging purposes, and let.s use orignial values that are used for sprite drawing - left, top, rith and bootom)

so instead of :

Field.drawIdlePlayers: redSprite x=400.5 y=622.0, blueSprite x=400.5 y=622.0, ball x=400.5 y=622.0, frameIndex=0
